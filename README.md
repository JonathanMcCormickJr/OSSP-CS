# 🚀 My Open-Source Study Path — Computer Science (OSSP-CS)

## Intro

Inspired by the [Open-Source Computer Science Degree](https://github.com/mvillaloboz/open-source-cs-degree) and [Open Source Society University](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science), this project aims to document my path toward becoming at least as knowledgable and competent in the field of Computer Science as a person with 2-years, 4-years, 6-years, and 8-years CS degrees, respectively. The following document outlines my study resources used. The groupings by Term are meant to pace and structure the course more or less according to a typical Computer Science track at a college or university. The focus is on the core Computer Science courses, but other subject matters will be included here and there as I see fit. 

## Why did I make OSSP-CS?

This project is for me to document my personal journey as a self-directed student of computer science. I recognize that the traditional college experience has lots of pros and cons. One of the pros is a sense of structure. That is something that I want to bring here.
