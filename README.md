## Intro

Inspired by the [Open-Source Computer Science Degree](https://github.com/mvillaloboz/open-source-cs-degree) and [Open Source Society University](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science), this project aims to document my path toward becoming at least as knowledgeable and competent in the field of Computer Science as a person with 2-years, 4-years, 6-years, and 8-years CS degrees, respectively. The following document outlines my study resources used. The groupings by Term are meant to pace and structure the course more or less according to a typical Computer Science track at a college or university. The focus is on the core Computer Science courses, but other subject matters will be included here and there as I see fit. 

## Why did I make OSSP-CS?

This project is for me to document my personal journey as a self-directed student of computer science. I recognize that the traditional college experience has lots of pros and cons. One of the pros is a sense of structure. That is something that I want to bring here. 

## Key:

| Progress key   | Item    | Term      | Degree   |
|----------------|---------|-----------|-----------|
| **Not started**| 🔴      | 🟥        |    ❤️      |
| **In progress**| 🟡      | 🟨        |    💛      |
| **Completed**  | 🟢      | 🟩        |    💚      |


## Table of Contents
### 💛 "Weatherstone Degree" (≈ 2-years associate's degree)
#### Named after the ["Weather Stone"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_rock), a primitive tool for meteorological measurement based mostly on the intuitive perception of the reader.  
* [🟩 Term 0: Andrews University: Fall 2019](/Term-00)
* [🟩 Term 1: Andrews University: Spring 2020](/Term-01)
* [🟩 Term 2: Andrews University: May 2020](/Term-02)
* [🟩 Term 3: Sololearn, Hack the Box Academy, edX, et al: Summer 2020 - Spring 2022](/Term-03)
* [🟨 Term 4: MIT OCW: Summer 2022 - Summer 2024](/Term-04)

### ❤️ "Fahrenheit Degree" (≈ 4-years bachelor's degree)
#### Named after the [Fahrenheit scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit) for measuring temperature (used mostly by the Americans), where the melting point of purified water ice is ~32 °F (31.9998 °F) and the boiling point of water is ~212 °F (211.971 °F). 
* [🟥 Term 5](/Term-05)
* [🟥 Term 6](/Term-06)

* [🟥 Term 8](/Term-08)

### ❤️ "Celsius Degree" (≈ 6-years master's degree)
#### Named after the [Celsius scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius) for measuring temperature (used mostly by the rest of the world), where the melting point of purified water ice is ~0 °C (−0.0001 °C) and the boiling point of water is ~100 °C (99.9839 °C). 
* [🟥 Term 9](/Term-09)

#### Named after the [Kelvin scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin) for measuring temperature (increments between points are ≈ to those of Celsius), but where absolute zero is 0 K (exact), the melting point of purified water ice is ~273 K (273.1499 K) and the boiling point of water is ~373 K (373.1339 K). 
* [🟥 Term 13](/Term-13)
* [🟥 Term 14](/Term-14)
* [🟥 Term 15](/Term-15)
* [🟥 Term 16](/Term-16)

## Study topic chooser

In an effort to prevent overthinking, I should use this aid to choose which subject I should study:

``` python
import random

classes = ["Calculus", "Computation Structures", "Computer Architecture", "Driver's License", "Intro to CS"]

selected_class = random.choice(classes)
print(f"You get to study {selected_class} RIGHT NOW!!!")
```

## [Future Course Options](./course-options.md)

Info on courses that I may choose to add to a future docket for my educational journey.

Have a suggestion to add? I'd love to hear it! Write a comment here on GitHub or tag me on Twitter [@LiberlandHacker](https://twitter.com/LiberlandHacker). 

## [Unfinished Courses](./unfinished-courses)
My progress for courses that I dropped for any given term and did not assign to a specific future term. 

## A word on file naming conventions
Where applicable, subject notes, code snippets, etc. will generally have the following naming convention. This is to preserve a sense of organization regarding my progress.  

[DATE CREATED YYYYMMDD]-[FILENAME].[EXTENSION]

### Example:

`20220623-myProgram.go`

## Academic Honesty

If you are a student who is interested in using my notes for your own study, please first check to make sure you do not violate your own institution's academic honesty policies by using my notes, which may include answers to graded and ungraded problems.

Of course, as long as your academic authorities allow it, you are welcome to use this repo as a resource for your own learning, subject to the included [LICENSE](LICENSE). 

## Notes on Notes
Note: **Not all notes are posted here.** Some are handwritten, as I find it more convenient in many cases, especially for notations which Markdown is not well-suited for. If you are an interested party who desires to review my handwritten notes for any course, please send me a request directly and I'll see what I can do for you.
