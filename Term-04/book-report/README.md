## Summary of Book Contents

### 1. Building Up the Computer Revolution

Humans need to process information in order to make the most out of life. Computers are devices that aid in math calculations. Computers have evolved through the past few centuries in order to enable us humans to save time and effort that would be required to perform complex calculations manually. Since (presumably) all information can be converted into a series of 1's (on's) and 0's (off's) sequences, computers can be used for basically anything which deals with information. Because of this automation, human life is enhanced. 

### 2. The Power of Binary Code

With math, there are many variables that we might take for granted. The base system that one uses is often one of those variables. While the decimal (0-9) system is prevalent in the modern world for everyday people, it was not always so widespread. Other civilizations have used different base systems. 

The binary (0-1) system is one that is particularly well-suited for the foundation of computers due to the fact that modern computers are overwhelmingly reliant on digital electronic circuits to function. An electronic impulse in a wire can be either 0 (low/no signal) or 1 (high signal). With these values (0 & 1) we can form long strings of them to form more complicated types of information, like decimal digits, the English Alphabet, other alphabets, special characters, audio wave values, and screen pixel values. Using combinations of these higher-order characters, one can (of course) form human-understandable words, sentances, articles, books, music, videos, websites, etc.

With binary, each place value has 2 possible states: 0 or 1. If a place value has `1`, and I were to add another `1` to it, then a `1` would carry over to the higher place value and the original place value would be assigned `0`.

So, to translate this visually:

|Decimal|Binary|
|---|---|
| 0  | 0 |
|1|1|
|2|10|
|3|11|
|4|100|
|5|101|
|6|110|
|7|111|
|8|1000|
|9|1001|
|10|1010|
|11|1011|
|12|1100|
|13|1101|
|14|1110|
|15|1111|

Now, let's try adding in binary.

|Decimal|Binary|
|-|-|
|13+4|1101+100|
|=17|=10001|

So as we can see, any natural number can be represented in binary as well as decimal. 

Using these, we can arbitrarily assign letters to certain binary number values. The American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) is one such system for doing so. Unicode integrated ASCII, along with other systems to be able to represent other language characters, etc.

Logic gates were developed in order to perform certain operations on information: AND, OR, and NOT. 

When dealing with any number greater than 1, binary requires more place values to represent it. Therefore, a base system like binary is relatively inefficient for use in systems where there is not an inherent advantage to using it. 

#### Example:

If I buy a book from a store, the page numbers would use up a small amound of ink. if the book is 100 pages long, the 100th page could be represented as follows:
|Base 100|Hex|Decimal|Binary|
|-|-|-|-|
|1|64|100|1100100|

So as we can see, different base systems can take up different quantities of characters, and thus different space and ink requirements. If the printer wanted to conserve resources, then using the decimal system would aid that goal more than the binary system. While other systems (Hex, etc.) would be even more resource-conserving to the printer than decimal, the everyday reader would likely be confused. Therefore, decimal is an optimal option for being both recognizable and efficient.


### 3. A Wartime Burst of Progress

War created heightened demand for computational tools. 
* Code making
* Code breaking
* Ballistics predictive math

Here are some notable moments in the development of computers:
* 1930: Vennevar Bush's differential analyzer
* 1936: Alan Turing publishes his paper "On Computable Numbers"; Claude Shannon shows the connection between symbolic logic and electrical circuits.
* 1937: George Stibitz builds a binary adder
* 1941: Konrad Zuse designs and builds the first general-purpose computer.
* 1943: Colossus goes into service cracking German codes.
* 1944: Howard Aiken's Mark I is released.
