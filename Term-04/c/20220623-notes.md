# Notes on C from Sololearn

## Introducing C
C is a 50+ years old, general-purpose programming language.

C is used for OS's (including Windows and many others) to complex 
programs like the Python interpreter, Git, Oracle DB, and many more.
C is versatile on purpose. It is a low-level language that relates 
closely to the way machines work while still being easy to learn.

> Understanding how computer memory works is an important aspect of 
> the C programming language. 

## Hello World!
```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```
OUTPUT: 
```
Hello, World!
```
As when learning any new language, the place to start is with the 
classic "Hello World!" program: Let's break down the code to understand 
each line:
`#include <stdio.h>` The function used for generating output is defined 
in `stdio.h`. In order to use the `printf` function, we need to first include 
the required file, also called a header file.

`int main()` 

The `main()` function is the entry point to a program. 
Curly brackets `{ }` indicate the beginning and end of a function (also called 
a code block). The statements inside the brackets determine what the function 
does when executed.

*Why is `int` used instead of `func`? I would like to find out.*

```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```
The `printf` function is used to generate output: Here, we pass the text `"Hello World!"` to it.
The `\n` escape sequence outputs a newline character. Escape sequences always begin with a backslash `\`.
The semicolon `;` indicates the end of the statement. Each statement must end with a semicolon.

`return 0;` This statement terminates the `main()` function and returns the value `0` to the calling process. The number `0` generally means that our program has successfully executed. Any other number indicates that the program has failed.


## Data Types


C supports the following basic data types:
`int`: integer, a whole number.
`float`: floating point, a number with a fractional part.
`double`: double-precision floating point value.
`char`: single character.

The amount of storage required for each of these types varies by platform.
C has a built-in `sizeof` operator that gives the memory requirements for a particular data type.
For example: The program output displays the corresponding size in bytes for each data type.
The `printf` statements in this program have two arguments. The first is the output string with a format specifier (%ld), while the next argument returns the sizeof value. In the final output, the %ld (for long decimal) is replaced by the value in the second argument.
Note that C does not have a boolean type.

A printf statement can have multiple format specifiers with corresponding arguments to replace the specifiers. Format specifiers are also referred to as conversion specifiers.
We will learn more about format specifiers in the upcoming lessons.
