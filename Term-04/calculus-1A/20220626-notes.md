## Formula Entry Problems

(ASCII math)

    Use + to denote addition; e.g. 2+3.

    Use − to denote subtraction; e.g. x-1.

    Use ∗ to denote multiplication; e.g. 2∗x.

    Use ∧ to denote exponentiation; e.g. x∧2 for x2.

    Use / to denote division; e.g. 7/x for 7x.

    Type pi for the mathematical constant π.

    Type e for the mathematical constant e.

    Type sqrt(x), sin(x), cos(x), ln(x), arccos(x), etc. for the known functions 'square root of x', sinx, cosx, lnx, arccosx etc. Note that parentheses are required.

    Use parentheses ( ) to specify order of operations.

    NOTE: You will get an error if you try to enter variables, like z, that are unspecified in the problem. You will get an error as you are typing if you have only one half “(" of a parenthesis. Just continue typing, and when you enter the closing parenthesis “)", the error will go away.

## Choose Your Own Calculus Adventure (pre-assessment)

### Algebra 

#### What is the slope of the line through the points (3,−5) and (1,−1)? 
    
Slope = rise / run
    
s = [-5-(-1)]/(3-1) = -4/2 = **-2**


#### The lines 3x+2y=7 [l0] and  x−3y=6 [l1] intersect in a point with what coordinates? 

##### isolate l0's y

3x + 2y = 7

2y = -3x + 7

y = (-3x + 7)/2

##### isolate l1's y

x - 3y = 6

-3y = -x + 6

y = (-x + 6)/(-3) 

y = -(-x + 6)/3 

y = (x-6)/3

##### Plot both functions on TI-84




##### Get intersection

(3,-1)


#### Simplify (1/x+1/y)^(−1)

(1/x+1/y)^(−1)

1/(1/x+1/y)

x + y



#### List all possible solutions to the equation x^3 − x^2 − 2^x = 0

(Use decimals only, not fractions, and separate answers with commas.) 

x^3 − x^2 − 2^x = 0

Graph it and look at the zeroes

All possible solutions = -1, 0, 2
