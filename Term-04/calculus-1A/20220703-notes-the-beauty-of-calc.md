# “The Beauty of Calculus,” a Lecture by Steven Strogatz

Notes by Jonathan McCormick, Jr.

Calculus is the language of the universe. If you will, it is "the language that God speaks."

Calc is about taking very complex problems and breaking them down to simpler problems. Dubbed 
the **"Infinity Principle"**, just keep slicing problems down to smaller, simpler problems ad
infinitum.

## Strategy 

1. Break big problem down to infintesimally small pieces
2. Solve for the tiny pieces (easy)
3. Put the pieces back together (hard)



Slicing = differential calc (easy)

Rebuilding = integral calc (hard)




Calc only works on things that are infinitely subdivisible aka "continuous". 
This can be more or less true in the real world: "Is matter REALLY infinitely 
subdivisible??" Hmm




## Big things in calc
1. curves 
2. motion
3. change


AKA "THE MATH OF CHANGE".



## pi r^2 comes to us from calc using the Infinity Principle

Loose example (chill, y'all)

Note: Things get clearer at infinity.

Infinite series. 

Archimedes' legacy included "Geri's Game", "Shrek", which features CGI. It has a LOT of curved surfaces which were all generated by creating triangles smaller and smaller to approximate a smooth curve.

Also, computer generated imaging has enabled physicians to simulate appearance results of surgery.

All the classical curves of the Greeks (cone slices) can now be thought of as equations.

You can approximate curvy things with straight things. (local linearization. Infinity Principle).

Curves can represent motion and change. 



Calc sometimes makes use of "Creative Fantasies" for the sake of problem-solving. 

Example:

Usain Bolt's (Berlin) speed over time. The ups and downs of his instantaneous speed show his individual strides, while the average speed shows us the trend. 

Lesson: even if calc might fail at the microscopic level, it can still be useful at helping us get the big picture.
