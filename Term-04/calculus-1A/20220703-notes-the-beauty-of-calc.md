Calculus is the language of the universe. If you will, it is "the language that God speaks."

Calc is about taking very complex problems and breaking them down to simpler problems. Dubbed 
the **"Infinity Principle"**, just keep slicing problems down to smaller, simpler problems ad
infinitum.

## Strategy 

1. Break big problem down to infintesimally small pieces
2. Solve for the tiny pieces (easy)
3. Put the pieces back together (hard)



Slicing = differential calc (easy)

Rebuilding = integral calc (hard)




Calc only works on things that are infinitely subdivisible aka "continuous". 
This can be more or less true in the real world: "Is matter REALLY infinitely 
subdivisible??" Hmm




## Big things in calc
1. curves 
2. motion
3. change


AKA "THE MATH OF CHANGE".



## pi r^2 comes to us from calc using the Infinity Principle

Loose example (chill, y'all)

Note: Things get clearer at infinity.
