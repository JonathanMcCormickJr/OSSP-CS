## Algebra .7/1

If `4x + ay = 7` AND `y` is used to represent a function of `x`, then `a ≠  0`

Why? Because if you isolate y on one side, it requires you to divide both sides by `a`. You cannot divide anything by 0 and still expect to get a definite answer. Therefore, `a ≠  0`.

`n!` means the product of all natural numbers from `n` to `1`.
