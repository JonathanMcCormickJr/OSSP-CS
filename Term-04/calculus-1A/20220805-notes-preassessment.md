## Algebra .8/1

If `4x + ay = 7` AND `y` is used to represent a function of `x`, then `a ≠  0`

Why? Because if you isolate y on one side, it requires you to divide both sides by `a`. You cannot divide anything by 0 and still expect to get a definite answer. Therefore, `a ≠  0`.



### Systems of Linear Equations

In order to make a system have no solutions, you need to change the coefficient of `x` to be the same for both, making the slope the same for both. This assumes that the equations are not already identical. The reason to do this is because parallel lines never intersect, which means that no matter which `x` value you plug in, you will never find the `y` values as being the same.

`n!` means the product of all natural numbers from `n` to `1`.
