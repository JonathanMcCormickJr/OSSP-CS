# Limit Laws
These are pretty intuative once you find the pattern. The limit of a sum is the sum of the limits. 

I found this explanation of the Limit Law for Multiplication to be worth noting: 

> If  limx→af(x)=L  and  limx→ag(x)=M,  then we can write
> 
> f(x) 	 = 	 L+ε1 
> g(x) 	 = 	 M+ε2 ,
> where  ε1,ε2→0  as  x→a . Then
> 
> f(x)g(x)=LM+ε1M+ε2L+ε1ε2. 
>  
> As  L  and  M  are constants and  ε1,ε2  tend to zero, all three error terms  ε1M ,  ε2L , and  ε1ε2  will go to zero as  x  approaches  a . Hence
> 
> limx→a[f(x)⋅g(x)]=L⋅M.
