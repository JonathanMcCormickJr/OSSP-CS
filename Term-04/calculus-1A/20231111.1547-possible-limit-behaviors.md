The last 2 are particularly interesting. 

The line that says, "A right- and/or left-hand limit could fail to exist due to blowing up to  ±∞ . (Example: Consider the function  1/x  near  x=0 .) In this case, we either say the limit blows up to infinity. We also say that the limit does not exist because  ∞  is not a real number!" recognizes 2 different ways of viewing the idea of when a limit blows up. This is probably going to be something I should watch out for when I get asked questions such as, "In situation xyz, does a limit exist as x-->a- ?"
