# Notes on limits of quotients


Mind the relative nature of quotients, including when working with very large or very small numbers. 

It does not matter whether you have `1000/5000` or `0.0001/0.0005`, they both have a ratio of `1:5`. 

REMEMBER: Functions in general are not necessarily continuous, but polynomials are.
