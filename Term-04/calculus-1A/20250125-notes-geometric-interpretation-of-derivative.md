# Geometric interpretation of the derivative

There are 3 main ways to interpret the derivative: 
1. Physical: the instantaneous rate of change.
2. Geometric: the slope of the tangent line.
3. Sensitivity measurement: If we change something by a small amount, how much does that change our results?

In this lesson, we will be covering the second of the three: The Geometric approach.
