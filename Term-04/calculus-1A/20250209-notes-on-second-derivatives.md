# Second derivatives

What if you want to determine a derivative OF a derivative? That's where second-order derivatives come in. 

First order derivatives: 

If `f(x) = x^3 - 6x`, then what is `df/dx`?

`df/dx = ___`

`f + df = (x + dx)^3 - 6(x + dx)`

`f + df = { (x + dx) * (x + dx) * (x + dx) } - 6x - 6*dx`

`f + df = { (x^2 + x*dx + x*dx + dx^2) * (x + dx) } - 6x -6*dx`

`f + df = { (x^2 + 2x*dx + dx^2) * (x + dx) } - 6x -6*dx`

`f + df = { x^3 + dx*x^2 + dx*2x^2 + 2x*dx^2 + x*dx^2 + dx^3 } - 6x -6*dx`

We can safely ignore all elements of this that are multiplied by a second- or third-power of `dx`, leaving us with: `f + df = x^3 + dx*x^2 + dx*2x^2 - 6x -6*dx`

Simplify further: `f + df = x^3 + 3x^2 * dx - 6x -6*dx`

Subtract our original `f = x^3 - 6x`, and we get `df = 3x^2 * dx - 6*dx`. 

We can now divide both sides by `dx`, leaving us with `df/dx = 3x^2 - 6` ✅

***
`3x^2 - 6` is itself a function, so if `g(x) = df/dx`, then what is the derivative of g?

`g = 3x^2 - 6`

`g + dg = 3(x + dx)^2 - 6`

`g + dg = 3(x + dx)(x + dx) - 6`

`g + dg = 3(x^2 + 2x*dx + dx^2) - 6`

Ignoring all higher powers of `dx`, we get: 

`g + dg = 3(x^2 + 2x*dx) - 6`

`g + dg = 3x^2 + 6x*dx - 6`

Subtract our equation `g = 3x^2 - 6`, and we get 
`dg = 6x*dx`

Divide by `dx` on both sides... 
`dg/dx = 6x` ✅

This is our second-derivative.

## Higher-order derivatives

### With prime notation, we simply add a tick mark for each layer of derivation. 

First-order derivative: `f'(x)`

Second-order derivative: `f''(x)`

### In Leibniz Notation, that is:

First-order derivative: `df/dx`

Second-order derivative: `d(df/dx)/dx`, or `d/dx {d/dx (f)}`, or `(d/dx)^2 * (f)`, or `(d^2 f)/dx^2`

We can keep this trend going.

| Description | Prime notation | Leibniz notation |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| First derivative | `f'(x)` | `df/dx` |
| Second derivative | `f''(x)` | `(d^2 f)/dx^2` |
| Third derivative | `f'''(x)` | `(d^3 f)/dx^3` |
| Fourth derivative | `f''''(x)` | `(d^4 f)/dx^4` |
