# 1 Basics of Information

What is "Information"? Data communicated or recieved that resolves the
most uncertainty about a particular fact or circumstance. 

Ex: in a standard card deck, "the card is a face card" is more 
informative than "the card is NOT the ace of spades". 


We will be working to use machines to work with information, and 
find ways to debug errors.
