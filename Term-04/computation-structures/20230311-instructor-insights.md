In the early '70's he was running a computer for a university and has
been developing his life-long interest for computers. 

His role models were his teachers. And he has found good vibes from teaching. 

This course has a history of taking student with a broad range of skill
levels with computers and programming.

It's important to keep lessons short and sweet in order to avoid 
distractions. 

Online education provides more opportunities for the use of the
scientific method through A/B testing. 

The human things, like droppping the chalk, or telling a joke, help make the course memorable for students. 

Terman says he does not believe in "dumb questions".

Having a rapid question-answer cycle helps make "stuck" experiences shorter, which is better for progressing throught the course.
