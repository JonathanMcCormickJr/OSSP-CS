# Computation Structures

MIT OCW | 6.004 | Spring 2017 | Undergraduate

## Tools 

In this course, I found it useful to automate some of the stuff involved. Such as for these:
* [Information equation I(x): `I(x) = log2(n/m) bits` OR `I(x) = log2(1/p) bits`](./)
* [Entropy equation H(x): `H(x) = E(I(x)) = ∑ᵢpᵢlog2(1/pᵢ)`](./20230314-h-of-x-calculator-entropy.py)
