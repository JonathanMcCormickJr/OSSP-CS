## 1 Intro

Computers are used in basically every area of human life. 

Computer design is heavily reliant on electrical engineering principles.

The power to drive a system must be carefully
1. transported
2. converted
3. isolated (from noise) and
4. delivered to the active devices in the system.

Functionality and reliability are super important, so it is critical that steps be taken to avoid noise from drowning out our signals.
