## TITLE: Computer Design and Architecture
by L. Howard Pollard
U of New Mexico

Book (c) 1990


## 1 Intro

Computers are used in basically every area of human life. 

Computer design is heavily reliant on electrical engineering  && computer science principles.

The power to drive a system must itself be carefully
1. transported
2. converted
3. isolated (from noise) and
4. delivered to the active devices in the system.

Functionality and reliability are super important, so it is critical that steps be taken to avoid noise from drowning out our signals.

Computers (at least classical computers) are limited in their capacity. When using computers for math, it is important to know whether or 
not the computer will be able to handle the entire math operation without introducing unacceptable errors. I have personally experienced this with some math programming operations in Python.

#### Aspects of Computer Engineering
1. Designing arithmetic elements in a system,
2. Creating system instructions,
3. Interconnction of specialized units to form the system,
4. Define and control data flow between different parts of the systems,
5. Techniques to communicate between computer and other devices (discs, tapes, terminals, etc.)

For this book, computer design issues will be address and tradeoffs will be evaluated.
