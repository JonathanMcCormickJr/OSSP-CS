# WELCOME

This course will cover how to drive. 

Being a driver is a HUUUUUGE responsibility. It gives you a lot of freedom, 
but that freedom can and will be restricted in the event of bad behavior on 
the road.

Your actions as a driver can be the difference between life and death. Literally. 

The state giveth, and the state taketh away. 

So prioritize safety and efficiency. Be responsible. Don't get distracted while driving.
