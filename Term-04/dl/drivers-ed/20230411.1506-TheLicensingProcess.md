# The Licensing Process (Oklahoma)

When you get your learners permit, you must bring primary and secondary IDs. Two primary IDs will work. Your passport and birth certificate should be fine. 

OK has a graduated licensing system. But since you are over 18 not all steps are necessary. 

Speeding accounts for 50% of teen traffic convictions.

If you get a court summons, show up. If you get a fine, don't just leave it unpaid. 

If you make a mistake, learn from it. Don't repeat it. Otherwise, your driving privileges will be reduced. 

## Phones

Don't interact with your phone while driving, except in emergency situations where it is absolutely necessary. 

If possible, pull over to call and text.
