# Traffic Control Laws ðŸ‘®ðŸš“

All drivers must obey traffic control information systems, including signs, lights, and uniformed personnel. 

ALWAYS exercise due care.

Safety belts must be worn during vehicle operation.

Never move a vehicle unless it can be done so with reasonable safety.

When emerging from a driveway, STOP when you approach a sidewalk or cross road. YOU need to stop there to get a better, updated view of traffic and pedestrian conditions befor proceeding.

There are unposted default speed limits for each state. 

When passing through on a road, stay in the center lane or right lane. Reserve the left lane for passing. Don't be that a--hole who blocks the passing lane.

Give emergency responders plenty of space when passing their scene. #SlowDownMoveOver

Don't tailgate. Leave plenty of room between your car and the one ahead. Generally the car behind is going to be found at fault in the event of a tailgating collision.

Signal turns with your hands or with turn signal lights.

Signal turns at least 100 feet in advance of your turn. Signal to the vehicle behind you that you are going to slow down by tapping the brakes a couple times. 


Intersections, crosswalks, RR Xing, these are types of intersections. 

Don't enter an intersection until you have confirmed space available to fully accomodate your car on the other side of the intersection.

NEVER open car doors unless it is reasonably safe to do so. 

Always limit time that the doors are open on roadsides to that which is necessary to unload passengers. 

When opening doors, don't interfere with traffic.
