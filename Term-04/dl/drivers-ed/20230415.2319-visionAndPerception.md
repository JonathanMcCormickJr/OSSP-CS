# Managing Visibility, Time, and Space
Vision and Perception

Trouble can come from any direction. Be aware of the area around your vehicle and of your intended path of travel. 

AVOID TROUBLE SITUATIONS. 


## Visual Scanning

As you drive, be constantly scanning key areas ahead of you:
* near
* far
* left
* right

Be on a constant lookout for conditions that require you to 
* Change speed
* Change position/path
* Communicate with others

Decision sequence:
1. Perceive
2. Decide
3. Act

Most new drivers do not look far enough ahead. 


You need 
* 30s: observe
* 15s: indentify escape routes
* 4s: min follow dist.


DO NOT GET FIXATED ON A SINGLE OBJECT ON THE ROAD. Keep scanning. Stay alert.


When crossing intersections, look
* Left until clear
* Right until clear
* Left (double-check)

...then proceed


## Viewing behind and to the sides
* Use mirrors
* Turn head briefly/check blind spot

## When backing out of a parking spot
* turn head back to view rear window directly to get better view.
* back out SLOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWLLLLLLLLLLLLYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY.

## When preparing for a change in direction, move your head in that direction to get a view for what's ahead and around that new path.

Like with anything in life where objective reality matters, you need to be in a constant state of gathering data, drawing conclusions, and acting based on those conclusions.
