# Braking and Backing

Be SMOOOOOOOOTH â˜º

Releasing the accelerator is a mild form of deceleration.

Drivers will take about 1/2 to 3/4 of a sec to identify a problem, plus another to implement action.

It is easier to brake in a straight line than in a sharp turn.

## ABS

Allows vehicle to retain some steering control during extreme braking. 

If your vehicle does not have ABS, then you will need to be careful to not lock up the wheels. Threshold braking is needed in emergencies. 

## Power assist brakes

Similar to power steering, ...but for brakes.


***

Nearly 30% of reported collisions are rear-end collisions.


## Backing

Start by making sure the steering wheel is set to 0. 

Check surroundings. 

Back out slowly. Idle speed is usually good enough. 

A spotter can be a great asset.
