# Changing Lanes and Turning

Changing lanes is like long division. It can seem complicated at first, but once you get the hang of it, it becomes easier.

If a car appears in either side mirror, then they are generally already too close for you to safely change lanes.

Just before changing lanes, check over your shoulder.

Signal your lane changes and turns.

When changing lanes, maintain normal speed.

## Turning

Turn into the lane that corresponds to the lane you turned from. While turning, stay in your lane. 

Be slow when turning (generally 5-15 mph).

Your rear wheels turn more steeply than your front ones. Leave gaps of margin while turning. 

If you make a mistake of which lane to be in, then follow the law, even if it means you must temporarily proceed with your current (but unintended) lane. Never block traffic to switch lanes. Be a decent human.

Signal intent to turn as soon as you can do so without causing confusion. 

## Reversing direction

* Go around block
* U-turn
* 2-point turn
* 3-point turn

Usually, going around the block is the best option. 

The 2-point can be done 2 ways, by using a driveway on the left or backing into a driveway on the right. The latter is usually the safer option.
