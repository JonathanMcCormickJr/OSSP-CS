In any parking area, beware of pedestrians walking to and from their vehicles. 

## Curb Parking

## Angled Parking

## Perpindicular Parking

For your car, get a feel for what reference points you can use to gauge your car's position in a parking space. This can help prevent overdoing or underdoing it.

## Parallel Parking

## Parking on hills

Think about physics. Turn wheels in whatever direction minimizes the risks in the event your car rolls downhill. 

## Long term parking
Take a picture of your parked vehicle so you know where you parked it.
