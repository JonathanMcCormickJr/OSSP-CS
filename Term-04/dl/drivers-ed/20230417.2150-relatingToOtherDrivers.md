# Relating to Other Drivers

Share the road with the other users.

Recognize and avoid traffic conflicts (when 2 or more cars want to occupy the same point in time-space).

Other drivers are human--they can and sometimes will make errors while driving. YOU, for your own sake, MUST learn to respond to situations of such drivers.

Communicate with (and listen to communication from) your fellow road users.
