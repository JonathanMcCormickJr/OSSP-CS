Pedestrians are the most vulerable group. Be kind to them. 

Pedestrians can act fooishly. YOU as the driver must compensate for their stupidity by taking every precaution to avoid a collision with them.

When a flashing first responder vehicle is driving, pull over to give them space to go where they need to go.

Give large trucks PLENTY of room. Never squeeze into a turn next to a turning truck--or you could be squeezed due to....geometry.

Increase following distance for motorcycles and scooters. 

Don't do anything drastic to save a squirrel--they are rodents with furry tails. Your passengers' safety is more important. 

If a moose jumps in your path, do what it takes to avoid it. You do NOT want to hit a moose.
