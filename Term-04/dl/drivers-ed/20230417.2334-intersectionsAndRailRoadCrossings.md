# Intersections and RailRoad Crossings

## Intersections
High-risk

Maintain space to your sides

You need to have a gap of at least 6 secs to cross an intersection. Get through in <=4 secs


## RailRoad Crossings

200 tons locomotive. + cars = 6000 tons

A full train is about the same mass as 4000 sedans.


1. ALWAYS EXPECT A TRAIN. 
2. NEVER TRY TO "BEAT" A TRAIN. 
3. Come to a FULL STOP before crossing tracks. Look both ways to check that it is clear before proceeding.
4. If multiple sets of tracks, verify each set as being clear. 

NEVER stop on the tracks for any reason.

In the rare event your car stalls on the tracks:
1. Check both ways for oncoming trains.
2. Evacuate vehicle and direct passengers to a place safe from the train and any debris that might result from a collision.
3. Call 911.
