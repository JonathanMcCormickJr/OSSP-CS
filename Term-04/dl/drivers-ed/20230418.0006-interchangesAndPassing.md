# Interchanges and Passing

Follow signs.

Use appropriate lanes for accelerating/decelerating.

Use ramps to get and off of freeways.

## Merging

Find gaps to merge.

When others are merging, do a courtesy lane change. Be a kind driver.

Get in your intended lane at the soonest safe opportunity.

## Passing
Before passing, consider the following:
1. Is passing legal?
2. Is it safe?
3. Is it worth the bother?

Head-on crashes are one of the worst types of collisions. Passing using an oncoming lane can increase the risk of a head-on collision.

## Being Passed

Be kind. Accomodate others' passing efforts where reasonable.
