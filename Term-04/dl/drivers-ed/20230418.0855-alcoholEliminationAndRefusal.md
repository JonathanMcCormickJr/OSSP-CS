# Alcohol Elimination and Refusal

It takes a long time (~11 hrs) to fully eliminate alcohol after you stop drinking.

**NEVER ride as a passenger to an impaired driver.** Call these for help getting a ride home:
* A sober friend
* Mom or Dad,
* Public transportation
* Taxi
* Uber/Lyft
* Police departments sometimes offer riding service to prevent drunk driving. 


Driving is hard enough. DUI makes it much harder to be safe.
