# Distracted Driving


Types of distractions
1. Visual: Something you look at instead of the road.
2. Mental: Something you think about instead of the road.
3. Physical: Something your body is engaged with instead of the car controls. 

Despite what people may think, hands-free telephone systems are still a huge distraction risk due to diverted attention.

Navigation systems can also cause distraction.

Other examples
* eating
* drinking
* music
* grooming
* navigational aids (maps, gps, etc.)
* Texting/calling
* Reading a book
* Knitting a red scarf for your stepaunt.

NEVER drive while using a phone. Pull over first.

Consider powering off your phone when you power on your car.
