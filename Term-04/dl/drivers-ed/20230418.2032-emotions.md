# Emotions

Your emotional state can impact your ability to drive safely.

## Anger is particularly dangerous.

Emotions can be contagious. But cultivated self-control can help flatten the curve.

Solution to feeling strong emotions: Find a safe way to chill. Take a break if needed. 

Expect other drivers to make mistakes. View them as simple errors.

Remain calm while driving. 

Don't push yourself. Give yourself plenty of time to reach your destination, regardless of delays. 

Use the horn sparingly.

Be kind. 

## Prevent other drivers from getting mad at you.

Don't force other drivers to use brakes or steer around you. 

If another driver is acting agressive, avoid escalation:
1. Avoid eye contact
2. Do not respond to their gestures
3. Be kind and forgiving, even if they are not.
4. Stay in your vehicle. It offers protection.
5. Have an escape plan. 
6. Call 911 if needed.
7. Drive to a place with witnesses and honk to get attention, if needed.
