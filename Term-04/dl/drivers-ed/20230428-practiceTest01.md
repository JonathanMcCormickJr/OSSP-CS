# Practice Test 01

This question is false. It is clear that it is a mistake or the person making it does not understand geometry.

In physical space, an object of constant size can be avoided using any degree of steering change, so long as 
there is also sufficient space for the steering (however gradual) to take full effect. However, the 
farther away the steering happens, the lower the intensity of steering required. Only a degree or two, spread 
out over miles, can still result in missing an object completely.
