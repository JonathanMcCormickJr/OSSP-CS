# Manual Transmissions

If you are a n00b, then avoid manual transmissions. Unless of course you want a bunch of extra work. 

The main controls of manual transmission:
1. Clutch
2. Gear shift lever

Press clutch pedal before shifting gears. 

In the middle of the gears is probably where "neutral" is. 

 ## Friction Point
 
 When you release the clutch and the transmission starts connecting with the engine.

**If you actually need to use a manual transmission, then DYOR. Don't rely on these notes.**
