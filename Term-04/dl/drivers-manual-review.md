## Copyright notes

**Despite being published by a taxpayer-funded government entity, 
the OK Driver's Manual is strictly copyrighted, as the following screenshot illustrates.**

How is this okay?

We, the taxpayers, literally paid for the state to write and publish this, 
and now they are using copyright law to try to keep people from sharing it? 

Regardless, this report is going to have my own analyis included 
and is NOT a substitute for actually reading the OK Driver's Manual 
yourself. I may have notes, quotes, and anecdotes based on content in the manual, 
but I encourage anyone who actually wants to get a DL to just go to the 
official resources directly. This report is just part of me documenting 
my personal educational journey. And right now my education journey could 
use a piece of blue and white plastic issued by the DMV/DPS that says I'm 
legally allowed to operate a motor vehicle on government roads. ðŸ¤·

You (Jonathan) need a DL to drive. Duh.
