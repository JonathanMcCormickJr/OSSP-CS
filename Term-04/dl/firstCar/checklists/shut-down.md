## 🟢 Shut-down Poem
By Jonathan A. McCormick, Jr. with ChatGPT, 10 May 2023.

```
As your car ride comes to an end,
Remember these checks, my dear friend:
Shift to park gear, don't forget,
Set the brake, to avoid regret.

Roll up windows, keep things tight,
Headlights off, to save battery's might.
Note fuel level, plan ahead,
Refuel if needed, no need to dread.

Turn off the engine, keys in hand,
Remove belongings, from this land.
Check for damage, issues to fix,
Dismiss your riders, whether one or six.

Set the alarms, if you must,
Lock the doors, no need to fuss.
Check the area, before you flee,
Safe and sound, for you and me.

These checks may seem small,
But they keep us safe overall.
So, remember them with ease,
And end each car ride with peace.
```
