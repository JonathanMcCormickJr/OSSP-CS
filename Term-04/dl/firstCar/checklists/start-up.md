## 🟢 Start-up Poem

By Jonathan A. McCormick, Jr. with ChatGPT, 10 May 2023.

```
As you start your car, before you go,
Make sure to check, to avoid woe:
Inspect the vehicle, to be sure,
No issues exist, that could occur.

Look all around, under the car,
For any object, that may mar,
Your safe drive ahead, with ease,
Clear the path, for a smooth breeze.

Safety hazards, watch them close,
Pedestrians, dogs, and those who pose,
A threat to you, on your drive,
Identify them, so you can thrive.

Step inside, and lock the doors,
Fasten those seat belts, including yours.
Check the gear, and parking brake,
Adjust your seat and wheel to avoid headache.

Set your mirrors to your approval,
Check your visual field, it's crucial.
Secure loose objects, strap them tight,
For a safer drive, with delight.

Start the engine, check warning lights,
Fuel gauge, windows, defrost in sight.
Plan your route, navigate with care,
Adjust climate control, prepare.

Low-beam headlights, on they go,
Your mind at ease, calm and slow.
Survey your surroundings, before you drive,
Take off and arrive, safe and alive.
```
