## Chapter 2
When driving, ALWAYS carry your license with you.

If you change address, notify the DPS immediately.

## Chapter 3

Your car must have valid registration, tag, title, and proof of liability insurance at all times. 

If you want to change the vehicle's ownership, you must do it through the tag agency. This makes sense because when it comes to stolen vehicles, it helps to have more than possession as evidence of ownership.
