There are trade-offs when it comes to what decisions to make during a DUI stop. 

Obviously, AVOIDANCE is the best strategy:
* Never drink and drive.
* Don't drive when you are impaired by non-alcohol causes (other drugs, fatigue, etc.)
* If you do get pulled over, don't give the officer any reason to believe you are impaired. 

However, if the officer decides to pursue a DUI stop, then there are a few things to keep in mind:
* "Officer, I do not consent to a field sobriety test."
* "Officer, I do not consent to any optional tests." 
* If the officer decides to pursue the breath/blood test, and state statutes demand you either take 
the test or forfeit your driving privileges, then there are no easy answers. You can refuse, but there
is a very high liklihood of losing your license for an amount of time. You can take the breath test, 
which is considered less reliable. (This can be a potential con, since it can lead to a false positive. 
But its lower reliability can also be useful if the test needs to be challenged later in court.)
If you choose to take the blood test, then a qualified professional will take the blood sample. However, 
mistakes can happen with either type of test. Such mistakes can be used to fight the results in court. 

The state has the burden of proof. If you ever DO get in a DUI-related legal situation, contact a 
qualified attorney in your area to help ensure that your legal rights are protected to the fullest 
extent.
