## Lecture 1: What is Computation?

Description: In this lecture, Dr. Bell introduces the theory of computation and explains some aspects of computational thinking. Programming languages are discussed, with an emphasis on basic Python syntax and data structures.


### Course Info

Take good notes. 

This is a fast-paced course. 

Position yourself to succeed!! 
* Read psets when they come out and come back to them later.

New to something? PRACTICE. Try things out. PRACTICE.

(Since I already have worked with Python and coding before, I will probably have an easier time with this course than if I were an absolute beginner at programming.)

#### 3 Core Goals of this Course
1. Knowledge of Concepts
2. Programming Skill
3. Problem-Solving

#### Topics
* Represent knowledge w. data structs. 
* **iteration** and **recursion** as computational metaphors
* **abstraction** of procedures and data types
* **organize and modularize** systems using object classes and methods
* different classes of **algorithms**, searching and sorting
* **completity** of algos.

Write code that is easy for others to understand. You YOURSELF will be wondering about what exactly you were thinking. LOL. 


### What is Computation?

What does a **computer** do?
* Fundamentally:
  * performs calculations (like a billion calcs per sec)
  * remembers results (like 100s of gigabytes of storage)
* What kinds of calculations?
  * **built-in** to the lang
  * Ones that **you define** as the programmer
* _Computers only know/do what you tell them._

Computers don't inherently know anything.

#### Types of Knowledge
* **Declarative knowledge** is statements of _fact_.
* **Imperative knowledge** is a recipe or a _"how to"_

The IDE that the instructor is using in this class in Anaconda. However, I may use something else, like this Linux VM on my laptop:

In this example, I am generating random nums using Python in my terminal. This would be useful if I need a random number. 

**When you are faced with a problem in your everyday life, consider whether using a computer would enhance your ability to solve it.**

When it comes to building a recipe (imperative knowledge) you need
1. A sequence of simple **steps**
2. **Flow of control** process that specifies when each step is executed. 
3. A means of determining **when to stop.** 

1+2+3 = an **algo**!

#### Computers are machines

Back in the day, there were **fixed-program computers**, like calculators (add, subtract, mult, divide, etc.)

Now, we also have **stored program computers**, where the machine stores and executes instructions. This is the modern computer.

Basic Machine Architecture
1. Memory (holds data and sequence of instructions)
2. Arithmetic Logic Unit (do primitive ops) 
3. I/O
4. Control Unit.

With **control flow** a program may or may not progress linearly, but it may "jump" around from one part of the instructions to another and back, etc. Skip a line. Repeat a line, etc. 

When the last instruction is finished, you might output something.

That is the basic way a computer works. 

#### Stored-program computer
* Secuence of **instructions stored** inside computer
    * Build from predefined set of primitive instructions
        1) Arithmetic & logic
        2) Simple tests
        3) Moving data
* Special program (interpreter) **executes each instruction in order**
  * Use tests to change flow of control through the sequence
  * Stop when done.

#### Basic Primitives 
Alan Turing said that you can **compute anything** using **6 Primitives**
1) Move left
2) Move right
3) Read
4) Write
5) Scan
6) Do nothing

Using those 6 and a piece of tape, he showed you can compute anything.

Programming langs derived/descended from these basic building block steps. 

**If you can compute x in one programming lang, you can also do it in another lang. **

**NOTE: Slides and code files up before each lecture**
* Highly encouraged to download them b4 lecure 
* Take notes and run code files when instructor does.
* Use computer to answer in-class practice exercises.
