# Assignment

Write a program that does the following in order:
1. Asks the user to enter a number “x”
2. Asks the user to enter a number “y” 
3. Prints out number “x”, raised to the power “y”.
4. Prints out the log (base 2) of “x”. 

```
Enter number x: 2
Enter number y: 3
X**y = 8
log(x) = 1
```

NOTE: I am a rebel, so I will NOT be using the instructor's system (Anaconda/Spyder), at least not for now. The core learning objectives should be IDE agnostic. 

Hints:

● To see how to use the print command, you may find it convenient to look at the 
input and output of the Python Wikibook. This will show you how to use print 
statements to print out values of variables.

● To see how to read input from a user's console into the Python environment, you 
may find it convenient to look at the same section (see for example the input() 
function)

● Reference the basic math section of the Python Wikibook to read more about 
using basic mathematical operators in Python 
2

● To take the logarithm of a variable, import either of the numpy or pylab 
packages. You can then call either numpy.log2 or pylab.log2 to calculate thelogarithm. See the Getting Started document on importing packages and the 
many Numpy examples online for more info. Googling the log2 function may 
take you here, which has some helpful info. 

● Remember that if you want to hold onto a value, you need to store it in a 
variable (i.e., give it a name to which you can refer when you want that 
value). You may find it convenient to look at the variables and strings section
of the Python Wikibook. (As you read through, remember that in Python 3.x 
you should be using input() not raw_input()). Take a look at the “Combining 
Numbers and Strings” sub-section, because you will be working with numbers 
and strings in this problem and will have to convert between the two using the 
str() and int() functions.
