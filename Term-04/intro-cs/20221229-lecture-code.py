#### COMMENTING LINES #######
#############################
# to comment MANY lines at a time, highlight all of them then CTRL+1
# do CTRL+1 again to uncomment them
# try it on the next few lines below!

#area = pi*(radius**2)
#print(area)
#radius = radius + 1
#area = pi*(radius**2)
#print(area)

#### AUTOCOMPLETE #######
#############################
# Spyder can autocomplete names for you
# start typing a variable name defined in your program and hit tab 
# before you finish typing -- try it below

# define a variable
a_very_long_variable_name_dont_name_them_this_long_pls = 0

# below, start typing a_ve then hit tab... cool, right!
# use autocomplete to change the value of that variable to 1

# use autocomplete to write a line that prints the value of that long variable
# notice that Spyder also automatically adds the closed parentheses for you!
