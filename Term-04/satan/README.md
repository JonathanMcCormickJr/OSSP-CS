# REL 66.6: Introduction to Satanism

Jonathan A. McCormick, Jr. 

A course that I have assembled for myself to learn the cultural meaning 
of "Satan" and the peoples who choose to embrace him. In addition, I will 
be making my own small contributions to Satanist literature and thought.

## Course Contents

### Readings

* Holy Bible passages

### Satan and the Law

### Conspiracy theories regarding Satanism.

### Write and record a Satanic hymn

### Write an essay summarizing your worldview of Satan and Satanism. 

In your essay, present original research on social attitudes toward Satan. 
Use a sample size of 200+ participants: 100+ from Alabama and 100+ from 
New Hampshire. Use an online phone number generator to help ensure 
random selection within each of the 2 states. Also, make sure that
you keep track of
1. Missed calls
2. Survey refusals

Ask them: 
1. What’s the most evil name you can think of?
2. What is your religious affiliation?
3. What's your political party affiliation?
4. If you had to pick one word to describe ‘Satan’, what would it be?
5. On a scale from 1 (totally good) to 10 (totally evil), what would you rate Satan as?
7. Do you know any Satanists personally?
