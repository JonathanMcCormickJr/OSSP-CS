# ⛧ Satanism I: Who is Satan? Who are his followers? ⛧

Jonathan A. McCormick, Jr. 

A course that I have assembled for myself to learn the cultural meaning 
of "Satan" and the peoples who choose to embrace him (as either a symbol 
or a literal being). In addition, I will  be making my own small 
contributions to Satanist literature and thought.

### Satan and the Law

#### Religious Liberty 

#### Self-identified Satanists in politics

### Conspiracy theories regarding Satanism.

### Write and record a Satanic hymn

### Write an essay summarizing your worldview of Satan and Satanism. 

#### Original research

In your essay, present original research on social attitudes toward Satan. 
Use a sample size of 200+ participants: 100+ from Alabama and 100+ from 
New Hampshire. Use an online phone number generator to help ensure 
random selection within each of the 2 states. Also, make sure that
you keep track of
1. Missed calls
2. Survey refusals

Ask them: 
1. What’s the most evil name you can think of?
2. What is your religious affiliation?
3. What's your political party affiliation?
4. If you had to pick one word to describe ‘Satan’, what would it be?
5. On a scale from 1 (totally good) to 10 (totally evil), what would you rate Satan as?
7. Do you know any Satanists personally? 
8. In which decade were you born?
9. What is your gender?

**Once you gather all your data, perform appropriate statistical 
ops on it to make it easy for the reader to visualize and understand
what the data means.**

### Create a mock leaflet for Satanism

Prep a small brochure design to introduce people to Satanism.

Include the most salient principles of Satanism, how to interact with Satanists in everyday life, and resources for digging deeper and/or finding help if the reader so desires.
