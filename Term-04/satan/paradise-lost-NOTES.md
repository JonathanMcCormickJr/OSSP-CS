> We may with more successful hope resolve
> To wage by force or guile eternal Warr
> Irreconcileable, to our grand Foe,
> Who now triumphs, and in thâ€™ excess of joy
> Sole reigning holds the Tyranny of Heavâ€™n.
> 
> So spake thâ€™ Apostate Angel, though in pain,
> Vaunting aloud, but rackt with deep despare:

272-321: Satan and his comrade seek to rise up from their Hellish ashes.


323-351

```
Is this the Region, this the Soil, the Clime,
Said then the lost Arch Angel, this the seat
That we must change for Heavâ€™n, this mournful gloom
For that celestial light?  Be it so, since hee
Who now is Sovran can dispose and bid
What shall be right: fardest from him is best
Whom reason hath equald, force hath made supream
Above his equals.  Farewel happy Fields
Where Joy for ever dwells: Hail horrours, hail
Infernal world, and thou profoundest Hell
Receive thy new Possessor: One who brings
A mind not to be changâ€™d by Place or Time.
The mind is its own place, and in it self
Can make a Heavâ€™n of Hell, a Hell of Heavâ€™n.
What matter where, if I be still the same,
And what I should be, all but less then hee
Whom Thunder hath made greater?  Here at least
We shall be free; thâ€™ Almighty hath not built
Here for his envy, will not drive us hence:
Here we may reign secure, and in my choyce
To reign is worth ambition though in Hell:
Better to reign in Hell, then serve in Heavâ€™n.
But wherefore let we then our faithful friends,
Thâ€™ associates and copartners of our loss
Lye thus astonisht on thâ€™ oblivious Pool,
And call them not to share with us their part
In this unhappy Mansion, or once more
With rallied Arms to try what may be yet
Regaind in Heavâ€™n, or what more lost in Hell?
```

Satan promotes alternative religions to humans (415-705). 

707-755
```
O Myriads of immortal Spirits, O Powers
Matchless, but with thâ€™ Almighty, and that strife
Was not inglorious, though thâ€™ event was dire,
As this place testifies, and this dire change
Hateful to utter: but what power of mind
Foreseeing or presaging, from the Depth
Of knowledge past or present, could have fearâ€™d,
How such united force of Gods, how such
As stood like these, could ever know repulse?
For who can yet beleeve, though after loss,
That all these puissant Legions, whose exile
Hath emptied Heavâ€™n, shall faile to re-ascend
Self-raisâ€™d, and repossess their native seat.
For me, be witness all the Host of Heavâ€™n,
If counsels different, or danger shunâ€™d
By me, have lost our hopes.  But he who reigns
Monarch in Heavâ€™n, till then as one secure
Sat on his Throne, upheld by old repute,
Consent or custome, and his Regal State
Put forth at full, but still his strength concealâ€™d,
Which tempted our attempt, and wrought our fall.
Henceforth his might we know, and know our own
So as not either to provoke, or dread
New warr, provokâ€™t; our better part remains
To work in close design, by fraud or guile
What force effected not: that he no less
At length from us may find, who overcomes
By force, hath overcome but half his foe.
Space may produce new Worlds; whereof so rife
There went a fame in Heavâ€™n that he ere long
Intended to create, and therein plant
A generation, whom his choice regard
Should favour equal to the Sons of Heaven:
Thither, if but to prie, shall be perhaps
Our first eruption, thither or elsewhere:
For this Infernal Pit shall never hold
Caelestial Spirits in Bondage, nor thâ€™ Abysse
Long under darkness cover.  But these thoughts
Full Counsel must mature: Peace is despaird,
For who can think Submission?  Warr then, Warr
Open or understood must be resolvâ€™d.

He spake: and to confirm his words, out-flew
Millions of flaming swords, drawn from the thighs
Of mighty Cherubim; the sudden blaze
Far round illuminâ€™d hell: highly they ragâ€™d
Against the Highest, and fierce with grasped armâ€™s
Clashâ€™d on their sounding shields the din of war,
Hurling defiance toward the vault of Heavâ€™n.
```

Also, Mammon seeks molten metal inside a volcano.  

Satan and his crew have considered appeasement toward God, the monarch of Heaven. But they have chosen Warr instead.
