Note in the above screenshot from a live concert video, 
there is an overhead structure in the shape of a 5-pointed 
star that is circumscribed by a circle. While the red and 
white stripes indicate the apparent 4th of July (American 
Independence Day) celebration, the uncanny resemblance to 
a satanic pentagram is notable, especially given "The Devil"
being a prominent character in this song.
