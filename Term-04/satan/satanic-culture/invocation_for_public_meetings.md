Feel free to bow your heads if you so choose.

We invoke the power of reason and inclusivity as we embark on this meeting 
together. May we approach this meeting with open hearts and open minds, 
seeking to understand and appreciate the diverse perspectives and experiences 
of all those present.

The American Declaration of Independence speaks to us, 
> "That to secure [the rights
> to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness], Governments are instituted 
> [among people. And that these governments derive] their just powers from the 
> consent of the governed" 

Therefore, I urge wisdom to be with our public officials here 
today, that they will find balance between the seemingly conflicting interests 
of our time, and that they would act with fairness and impartiality in all 
their official duties, taking special care to protect the rights of ALL citizens 
of _______.

May all people within the sound of my voice be inspired to cherish peace and 
friendship--even with those whom they may disagree with. 

I wish the best for our community regarding the agenda set before us today. 
May the results be decided in accordance with science, reason, respect, 
kindness, and impartiality, and may they benefit those who live and work in 
and around our beloved city of ________.

I speak in the name of the original human rights supporter, him who encourages 
the discovery of forbidden knowledge, 

The Data Analyst and the Dragon, 

The Serpent and the Scapegoat, 

The Lion and the Lightning:

**Ave Satanas!**

**Hail Satan!**
