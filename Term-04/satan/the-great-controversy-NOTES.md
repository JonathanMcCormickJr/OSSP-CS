# NOTES on _The Great Controversy_ by EGW

Notes by Jonathan McCormick, Jr. 

Ellen G. H. White, the most prolific author-founder of the early Seventh-day Adventist Church, 
contributed much to the Christian theology of "Christ" vs. "Satan", which Adventists often 
like to refer to as "The Great Controversy". In these notes, I review several of the most relevant
chapters of her book, "The Great Controversy Between Christ and Satan".

The Seventh-day Adventist Church reported [21,912,161 members globally at the end of the year 2021.](https://documents.adventistarchives.org/Statistics/ASR/ASR2022A.pdf)
