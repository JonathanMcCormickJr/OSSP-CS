## Genesis 1-3 ðŸ˜ˆ Satan: the Serpent 

Creationist worldview. God is the Creator "of the heaven and the earth." (1:1)

6th day of Creation: Day of Mankind. 

> "So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created
he him; male and female created he them. ...And the evening and the morning were the sixth day." (1:27-31)

God puts trees in Eden:

> "And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he
put the man whom he had formed. And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil." (2:8-9)

Got specifies a forbidden fruit tree. The penalty for disobedience is death.

> "And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the
garden thou mayest freely eat: But of the tree of the knowledge
of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou
eatest thereof thou shalt surely die." (2:16-17)

### Introduction of Satan as a serpent in Eden

Gen 3 (emphasis added).

>"3:1 Now the **serpent was more subtil** than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?  3:2 And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
3:3 But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden,
God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
3:4 **And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:** 
3:5 **For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.**
3:6 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that
it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one
wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto
her husband with her; and he did eat.
3:7 **And the eyes of them both were opened,** and they knew that they
were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves
aprons.
3:8 And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.
3:9 And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art
thou?  3:10 And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was
afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.
3:11 And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
3:12 And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she
gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
3:13 And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And **the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.**
3:14 And **the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done
this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the
field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the
days of thy life:** 3:15 **And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.**
3:16 Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and
thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy
desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
3:17 And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee,
saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake;
in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life; 3:18 Thorns
also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field; 3:19 In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for
dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.
3:20 And Adam called his wifeâ€™s name Eve; because she was the mother
of all living.
3:21 Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of
skins, and clothed them.
3:22 **And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:** 3:23 **Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.**
3:24 **So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.**"

God creates this "very good" (1:31) world. He puts humans on it as rulers in a divine-right fashion. But God, as the emperor over these rulers, has a demand: Don't eat the fruit of "the tree of knowledge of good and evil." 

Along comes the "serpent"/snake (traditionally interpreted as a morph of Satan).

This Serpent convinces Eve (debatably Adam's second wife after Lilith) to eat fruit from the forbidden tree: the tree of KNOWLEDGE. The Serpent promotes to Eve that the fruit will cause "[her] eyes [to] be opened, and [that the eaters] shall be as gods, knowing good and evil."

While Satan is often viewed by Christians as being a deceiver, in this case he is actually telling the truth, as subsequent verses show. 

**"Your eyes shall be opened,"**
  * "3:7 And the eyes of them both were opened,"


**"Ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil."**
  * "3:22 And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil..."

The BAD consequences happen as a result of God's arbitrary authority. 

God--as the divine emperor--decides to set the death penalty for disobedience, despite there being no victim. He also sets this penalty as being due on the same "day" as the offense took place. However, he says it in such a way that it could be interpreted as the fruit itself causing death, perhaps like a sort of poisonous fruit. 

> "2:17 But of the tree of the knowledge
of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for **in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.**" (emph added)

The Serpent disagrees with the notion that the fruit itself is deadly, telling Eve, "**Ye shall not surely die**..." (3:4).

And, as it turns out, the Serpent was right in terms of the fruit itself, but wrong in terms of God exercising arbitrary authority in order to un-alive the offenders. 

The last part of Genisis 3 makes clear that God expelled Adam and Eve from Eden (thus denying them immortality). 

> "So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden
of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life." (3:24)

However, since the book continues with Adam and Eve having kids and living for a long time afterwards, one can reasonably assume that God was lying about the same-day-death part. An exception would be if the reader chooses to interpret "day" in the Adventist sense, where 1 prophetic day = 1000 literal years. Since Genesis 5:3 says Adam lived a total of 935 years, and since 935<1000, God has a slight bit of plausible explanation for the "day" thing. But for those who want to interpret it literally, God was clearly incorrect on this point as well. 

When God confronts his disobedient subjects, they blame each other. Adam blames Eve. Eve blames the Serpent. God places curses on each of them which makes their lives more difficult. 

### In summary

**Satan enters the scene in Genesis in the form of a snake. He is highly intelligent, crafty, subversive, and (in most respects) factually correct in his predictions. He is the ultimate blame recipient when things go wrong. He is the underdog. He tempts people to rebel, to seek knowledge, and to seek liberation and self-empowerment.**



## Leviticus 16 ðŸ˜ˆ Satan: the Scapegoat

[emph. added]:

> "16:5 And he [Aaron] shall take of the congregation of the children of Israel **two kids of the goats for a sin offering,** and one ram for a burnt offering.
> ...
> 16:7 And he shall take the two goats, and present them before the LORD at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
> 16:8 And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; **one lot for the LORD, and the other lot for the scapegoat.**
> 16:9 And Aaron shall **bring the goat upon which the LORDâ€™s lot fell, and offer him for a sin offering.**
> 16:10 **But the goat, on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat, shall be presented alive before the LORD, to make an atonement with him, and to let him go for a scapegoat into the wilderness.**
> ...
> 16:15 Then shall he **kill the goat of the sin offering**, that is for the people, and bring his blood within the vail, and do with that blood as he did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it upon the mercy seat, and before the mercy seat: 16:16 And he shall make an atonement for the holy place, because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions in all their sins: and so shall he do for the tabernacle of the congregation, that remaineth among them in the midst of their uncleanness.
> ...
> 16:20 And when he hath made an end of reconciling the holy place, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar, he shall **bring the live goat**: 16:21 And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins, putting them upon the head of the goat, and shall send him away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderness: 16:22 **And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited: and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness.** 
> ..."

In this book of ritual rulues for the nation of Israel, God directs the high priest (Aaron) to make a bunch of animal sacrifices. In the SDA Christian tradition, these sacrifices are often viewed as being typical forshadowing of Jesus Christ (the "Lamb" of God) and his death on by crucifixion. 

But in this chapter, there is not just one goat, but two. These two goats are treated very differently.

Goat #1 is assigned the role of "The LORD's goat". 

Goat #2 is assigned the role of the "scapegoat". 

The LORD's goat is killed and its bodily fluids, etc. are used in a generally recognizable pattern. The innocent animal dies because the human sinned and God demands blood when sin happens. Sounds usual. 

But the Scapegoat is NOT killed. Instead, the scapegoat receives the symbolic guilt of the transgressions of all the Israelites during that year. And then the scapegoat is released into the wilderness. 

This has been interpreted by some as being typical forshadowing of Satan (the ultimate blame recipient) being placed on a lifeless earth during the Millenium of the Book of Revelation. By having guilt for sins be transferred en masse to a single villian, God and his followers are able to be reconciled. 


### In summary

**Satan is the antitypical scapegoat. The ultimate guilt recipient.**

## 1 Chronicles 21:1-17 ðŸ˜ˆ Satan: the Data Analyst 

[Emph. added]

> "21:1 **And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel.**
> 21:2 And David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people, Go, number Israel from Beersheba even to Dan; and bring the number of them to me, that I may know it.
> ...
> 21:7 **And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote
Israel.** 
> 21:8 And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, because I have done this thing: but now, I beseech thee, do away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.
> 21:9 And the LORD spake unto Gad, Davidâ€™s seer, saying, 21:10 Go and tell David, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three things: choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.
> 21:11 So Gad came to David, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Choose thee 21:12 Either three yearsâ€™ famine; or three months to be destroyed before thy foes, while that the sword of thine enemies overtaketh thee; or else three days the sword of the LORD, even the pestilence, in the land, and the angel of the LORD destroying throughout all the coasts of Israel. Now therefore advise thyself what word I shall bring again to him that sent me.
> 21:13 And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall now into the hand of the LORD; _for very great are his mercies_: but let me not fall into the hand of man.
> 21:14 So the LORD sent pestilence upon Israel: and there fell of
Israel seventy thousand men.
> 21:15 And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was destroying, the LORD beheld, and he repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed, It is enough, stay now thine hand. And the angel of the LORD stood by the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.
> 21:16 And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the LORD
stand between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword in his
hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders of
Israel, who were clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces.
> 21:17 And David said unto God, Is it not I that commanded the people to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done evil indeed; but as for these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, O LORD my God, be on me, and on my fatherâ€™s house; but not on thy people, that they should be plagued."


Here, Satan is blamed for tempting King David to...

...run a census.

Yeah. Worst crime ever, right? He'll be on the FBI's most wanted list in no time. 

And because David succumbed to Satan's temptation, God sends divine punishment upon Israel in retaliation for such a monstrous evil as a census. 

Lots of people die. 

Sounds like a reasonable response, right?

This God loves capital punishment. He also loves keeping his people in ignorance on certain topics. 

### In summary

**Satan is at it again: tempting humanity to seek knowledge (in this case through empirical data), even when such data collection makes God angry.**


## Job ðŸ˜ˆ Satan: the Afflicter

[Emph. added]

> "1:6 Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and **Satan came also among them.**
> 1:7 And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, **From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.**
> 1:8 And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?  1:9 **Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?  1:10 Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.
> 1:11 But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face.**
> 1:12 And **the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power;** only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.
> 1:13 And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brotherâ€™s house: 1:14 And there camea messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them: 1:15 And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
> 1:16 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
> 1:17 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
> 1:18 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brotherâ€™s house: 1:19 And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee. 
> 1:20 Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and
fell down upon the ground, and worshipped, 1:21 And said, Naked came I out of my motherâ€™s womb, and naked shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.
> 1:22 In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.
> 2:1 Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, **and Satan came also among them to present himself before the LORD.** 
> 2:2 And the LORD said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.
> 2:3 And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause.
> 2:4 And **Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life.
> 2:5 But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face.
> 2:6 And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thine hand; but save his life.
> 2:7 So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.**
> ...
> 2:9 Then said his [Job's] wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity?  curse God, and die. 2:10 But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips."

So there is this God-fearing man named "Job". God is pretty proud of this dude. 

Satan comes as a participant in a gathering of "the sons of God". God brags to Satan about Job's loyalty.

Satan argues that Job is loyal because of the benefits that he receives from God. So God allows Satan to destroy Job's loved ones and material wealth. 

Another gathering of "the sons of God" happens. God and Satan have a similar argument. But this time Satan argues that Job is loyal to God because of good health. So God allows Satan to plague Job with painful sores. 

And Job still refused to curse God. But Job does make clear that his life is a living hell. 

And then God gets an ego boost in the end. 

### In summary of Job

**Satan is a delegate to a meeting of supernatural beings. He habitually goes "to and fro in the earth," and walks "up and down in it". He tries and fails while tempting Job to commit a thought crime of cursing God for the Problem of Evil, despite the fact that he makes Job's life miserable.** 

## Isaiah 14 ðŸ˜ˆ

[emph. added]

> 14:1 For the LORD will have mercy on Jacob, and will yet choose Israel, and set them in their own land: and the strangers shall be joined with them, and they shall cleave to the house of Jacob. 14:2 And the people shall take them, and bring them to their place: and the house of Israel shall possess them in the land of the LORD for servants and handmaids: and they shall take them captives, whose captives they were; and they shall rule over their oppressors. 14:3 And it shall come to pass in the day that the LORD shall give thee rest from thy sorrow, and from thy fear, and from the hard bondage wherein thou wast made to serve, 14:4 That thou shalt take up this proverb against the king of Babylon, and say, How hath the oppressor ceased! the golden city ceased!  14:5 The LORD hath broken the staff of the wicked, and the sceptre of the rulers. 14:6 He who smote the people in wrath with a continual stroke, he that ruled the nations in anger, is persecuted, and none hindereth. 14:7 The whole earth is at rest, and is quiet: they break forth into singing. 14:8 Yea, the fir trees rejoice at thee, and the cedars of Lebanon, saying, Since thou art laid down, no feller is come up against us. 14:9 Hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy coming: it stirreth up the dead for thee, even all the chief ones of the earth; it hath raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations. 14:10 All they shall speak and say unto thee, Art thou also become weak as we? art thou become like unto us?  14:11 Thy pomp is brought down to the grave, and the noise of thy viols: the worm is spread under thee, and the worms cover thee. 14:12 How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations! 14:13 For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north: 14:14 I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High. 14:15 Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit. 14:16 They that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee, and consider thee, saying, Is this the man that made the earth to tremble, that did shake kingdoms; 14:17 That made the world as a wilderness, and destroyed the cities thereof; that opened not the house of his prisoners?  14:18 All the kings of the nations, even all of them, lie in glory, every one in his own house. 14:19 But thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch, and as the raiment of those that are slain, thrust through with a sword, that go down to the stones of the pit; as a carcase trodden under feet. 14:20 Thou shalt not be joined with them in burial, because thou hast destroyed thy land, and slain thy people: the seed of evildoers shall never be renowned. 14:21 Prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their fathers; that they do not rise, nor possess the land, nor fill the face of the world with cities. 14:22 For I will rise up against them, saith the LORD of hosts, and cut off from Babylon the name, and remnant, and son, and nephew, saith the LORD. 14:23 I will also make it a possession for the bittern, and pools of water: and I will sweep it with the besom of destruction, saith the LORD of hosts. 14:24 The LORD of hosts hath sworn, saying, Surely as I have thought, so shall it come to pass; and as I have purposed, so shall it stand: 14:25 That I will break the Assyrian in my land, and upon my mountains tread him under foot: then shall his yoke depart from off them, and his burden depart from off their shoulders 14:26 This is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth: and this is the hand that is stretched out upon all the nations. 14:27 For the LORD of hosts hath purposed, and who shall disannul it? and his hand is stretched out, and who shall turn it back?  14:28 In the year that king Ahaz died was this burden. 14:29 Rejoice not thou, whole Palestina, because the rod of him that smote thee is broken: for out of the serpentâ€™s root shall come forth a cockatrice, and his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent. 14:30 And the firstborn of the poor shall feed, and the needy shall lie down in safety: and I will kill thy root with famine, and he shall slay thy remnant. 14:31 Howl, O gate; cry, O city; thou, whole Palestina, art dissolved: for there shall come from the north a smoke, and none shall be alone in his appointed times. 14:32 What shall one then answer the messengers of the nation? That the LORD hath founded Zion, and the poor of his people shall trust in it.
