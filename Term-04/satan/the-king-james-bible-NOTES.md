NOTE: The text quotations of the KJV Bible may have emphasis added. 

## Genesis 1-3 ðŸ˜ˆ Satan: the Serpent 

Creationist worldview. God is the Creator "of the heaven and the earth." (1:1)

6th day of Creation: Day of Mankind. 

> "So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created
he him; male and female created he them. ...And the evening and the morning were the sixth day." (1:27-31)

God puts trees in Eden:

> "And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he
put the man whom he had formed. And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil." (2:8-9)

Got specifies a forbidden fruit tree. The penalty for disobedience is death.

> "And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the
garden thou mayest freely eat: But of the tree of the knowledge
of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou
eatest thereof thou shalt surely die." (2:16-17)

### Introduction of Satan as a serpent in Eden

Gen 3 (emphasis added).

>"3:1 Now the **serpent was more subtil** than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?  3:2 And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
3:3 But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden,
God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
3:4 **And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:** 
3:5 **For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.**
3:6 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that
it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one
wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto
her husband with her; and he did eat.
3:7 **And the eyes of them both were opened,** and they knew that they
were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves
aprons.
3:8 And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.
3:9 And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art
thou?  3:10 And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was
afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.
3:11 And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
3:12 And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she
gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
3:13 And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And **the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.**
3:14 And **the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done
this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the
field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the
days of thy life:** 3:15 **And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.**
3:16 Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and
thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy
desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
3:17 And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee,
saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake;
in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life; 3:18 Thorns
also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field; 3:19 In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for
dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.
3:20 And Adam called his wifeâ€™s name Eve; because she was the mother
of all living.
3:21 Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of
skins, and clothed them.
3:22 **And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:** 3:23 **Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.**
3:24 **So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.**"

God creates this "very good" (1:31) world. He puts humans on it as rulers in a divine-right fashion. But God, as the emperor over these rulers, has a demand: Don't eat the fruit of "the tree of knowledge of good and evil." 

Along comes the "serpent"/snake (traditionally interpreted as a morph of Satan).

This Serpent convinces Eve (debatably Adam's second wife after Lilith) to eat fruit from the forbidden tree: the tree of KNOWLEDGE. The Serpent promotes to Eve that the fruit will cause "[her] eyes [to] be opened, and [that the eaters] shall be as gods, knowing good and evil."

While Satan is often viewed by Christians as being a deceiver, in this case he is actually telling the truth, as subsequent verses show. 

**"Your eyes shall be opened,"**
  * "3:7 And the eyes of them both were opened,"


**"Ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil."**
  * "3:22 And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil..."

The BAD consequences happen as a result of God's arbitrary authority. 

God--as the divine emperor--decides to set the death penalty for disobedience, despite there being no victim. He also sets this penalty as being due on the same "day" as the offense took place. However, he says it in such a way that it could be interpreted as the fruit itself causing death, perhaps like a sort of poisonous fruit. 

> "2:17 But of the tree of the knowledge
of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for **in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.**" (emph added)

The Serpent disagrees with the notion that the fruit itself is deadly, telling Eve, "**Ye shall not surely die**..." (3:4).

And, as it turns out, the Serpent was right in terms of the fruit itself, but wrong in terms of God exercising arbitrary authority in order to un-alive the offenders. 

The last part of Genisis 3 makes clear that God expelled Adam and Eve from Eden (thus denying them immortality). 

> "So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden
of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life." (3:24)

However, since the book continues with Adam and Eve having kids and living for a long time afterwards, one can reasonably assume that God was lying about the same-day-death part. An exception would be if the reader chooses to interpret "day" in the Adventist sense, where 1 prophetic day = 1000 literal years. Since Genesis 5:3 says Adam lived a total of 935 years, and since 935<1000, God has a slight bit of plausible explanation for the "day" thing. But for those who want to interpret it literally, God was clearly incorrect on this point as well. 

When God confronts his disobedient subjects, they blame each other. Adam blames Eve. Eve blames the Serpent. God places curses on each of them which makes their lives more difficult. 

### In summary

**Satan enters the scene in Genesis in the form of a snake. He is highly intelligent, crafty, subversive, and (in most respects) factually correct in his predictions. He is the ultimate blame recipient when things go wrong. He is the underdog. He tempts people to rebel, to seek knowledge, and to seek liberation and self-empowerment.**



## Leviticus 16 ðŸ˜ˆ Satan: the Scapegoat

[emph. added]:

> "16:5 And he [Aaron] shall take of the congregation of the children of Israel **two kids of the goats for a sin offering,** and one ram for a burnt offering.
> ...
> 16:7 And he shall take the two goats, and present them before the LORD at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
> 16:8 And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; **one lot for the LORD, and the other lot for the scapegoat.**
> 16:9 And Aaron shall **bring the goat upon which the LORDâ€™s lot fell, and offer him for a sin offering.**
> 16:10 **But the goat, on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat, shall be presented alive before the LORD, to make an atonement with him, and to let him go for a scapegoat into the wilderness.**
> ...
> 16:15 Then shall he **kill the goat of the sin offering**, that is for the people, and bring his blood within the vail, and do with that blood as he did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it upon the mercy seat, and before the mercy seat: 16:16 And he shall make an atonement for the holy place, because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions in all their sins: and so shall he do for the tabernacle of the congregation, that remaineth among them in the midst of their uncleanness.
> ...
> 16:20 And when he hath made an end of reconciling the holy place, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar, he shall **bring the live goat**: 16:21 And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins, putting them upon the head of the goat, and shall send him away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderness: 16:22 **And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited: and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness.** 
> ..."

In this book of ritual rulues for the nation of Israel, God directs the high priest (Aaron) to make a bunch of animal sacrifices. In the SDA Christian tradition, these sacrifices are often viewed as being typical forshadowing of Jesus Christ (the "Lamb" of God) and his death on by crucifixion. 

But in this chapter, there is not just one goat, but two. These two goats are treated very differently.

Goat #1 is assigned the role of "The LORD's goat". 

Goat #2 is assigned the role of the "scapegoat". 

The LORD's goat is killed and its bodily fluids, etc. are used in a generally recognizable pattern. The innocent animal dies because the human sinned and God demands blood when sin happens. Sounds usual. 

But the Scapegoat is NOT killed. Instead, the scapegoat receives the symbolic guilt of the transgressions of all the Israelites during that year. And then the scapegoat is released into the wilderness. 

This has been interpreted by some as being typical forshadowing of Satan (the ultimate blame recipient) being placed on a lifeless earth during the Millenium of the Book of Revelation. By having guilt for sins be transferred en masse to a single villian, God and his followers are able to be reconciled. 


### In summary

**Satan is the antitypical scapegoat. The ultimate guilt recipient.**

## 1 Chronicles 21:1-17 ðŸ˜ˆ Satan: the Data Analyst 

[Emph. added]

> "21:1 **And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel.**
> 21:2 And David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people, Go, number Israel from Beersheba even to Dan; and bring the number of them to me, that I may know it.
> ...
> 21:7 **And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote
Israel.** 
> 21:8 And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, because I have done this thing: but now, I beseech thee, do away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.
> 21:9 And the LORD spake unto Gad, Davidâ€™s seer, saying, 21:10 Go and tell David, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three things: choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.
> 21:11 So Gad came to David, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Choose thee 21:12 Either three yearsâ€™ famine; or three months to be destroyed before thy foes, while that the sword of thine enemies overtaketh thee; or else three days the sword of the LORD, even the pestilence, in the land, and the angel of the LORD destroying throughout all the coasts of Israel. Now therefore advise thyself what word I shall bring again to him that sent me.
> 21:13 And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall now into the hand of the LORD; _for very great are his mercies_: but let me not fall into the hand of man.
> 21:14 So the LORD sent pestilence upon Israel: and there fell of
Israel seventy thousand men.
> 21:15 And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was destroying, the LORD beheld, and he repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed, It is enough, stay now thine hand. And the angel of the LORD stood by the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.
> 21:16 And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the LORD
stand between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword in his
hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders of
Israel, who were clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces.
> 21:17 And David said unto God, Is it not I that commanded the people to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done evil indeed; but as for these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, O LORD my God, be on me, and on my fatherâ€™s house; but not on thy people, that they should be plagued."


Here, Satan is blamed for tempting King David to...

...run a census.

Yeah. Worst crime ever, right? He'll be on the FBI's most wanted list in no time. 

And because David succumbed to Satan's temptation, God sends divine punishment upon Israel in retaliation for such a monstrous evil as a census. 

Lots of people die. 

Sounds like a reasonable response, right?

This God loves capital punishment. He also loves keeping his people in ignorance on certain topics. 

### In summary

**Satan is at it again: tempting humanity to seek knowledge (in this case through empirical data), even when such data collection makes God angry.**


## Job ðŸ˜ˆ Satan: the Afflicter

[Emph. added]

> "1:6 Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and **Satan came also among them.**
> 1:7 And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, **From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.**
> 1:8 And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?  1:9 **Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?  1:10 Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.
> 1:11 But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face.**
> 1:12 And **the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power;** only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.
> 1:13 And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brotherâ€™s house: 1:14 And there camea messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them: 1:15 And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
> 1:16 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
> 1:17 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
> 1:18 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brotherâ€™s house: 1:19 And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee. 
> 1:20 Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and
fell down upon the ground, and worshipped, 1:21 And said, Naked came I out of my motherâ€™s womb, and naked shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.
> 1:22 In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.
> 2:1 Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, **and Satan came also among them to present himself before the LORD.** 
> 2:2 And the LORD said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.
> 2:3 And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause.
> 2:4 And **Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life.
> 2:5 But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face.
> 2:6 And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thine hand; but save his life.
> 2:7 So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.**
> ...
> 2:9 Then said his [Job's] wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity?  curse God, and die. 2:10 But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips."

So there is this God-fearing man named "Job". God is pretty proud of this dude. 

Satan comes as a participant in a gathering of "the sons of God". God brags to Satan about Job's loyalty.

Satan argues that Job is loyal because of the benefits that he receives from God. So God allows Satan to destroy Job's loved ones and material wealth. 

Another gathering of "the sons of God" happens. God and Satan have a similar argument. But this time Satan argues that Job is loyal to God because of good health. So God allows Satan to plague Job with painful sores. 

And Job still refused to curse God. But Job does make clear that his life is a living hell. 

And then God gets an ego boost in the end. 

### In summary of Job

**Satan is a delegate to a meeting of supernatural beings. He habitually goes "to and fro in the earth," and walks "up and down in it". He tries and fails while tempting Job to commit a thought crime of cursing God for the Problem of Evil, despite the fact that he makes Job's life miserable.** 

## Isaiah 14 ðŸ˜ˆ Satan: Lucifer: Ambition

[emph. added]

> "14:1 For the LORD will have mercy on Jacob, and will yet choose Israel, and set them in their own land: and the strangers shall be joined with them, and they shall cleave to the house of Jacob. 14:2 And the people shall take them, and bring them to their place: and the house of Israel shall possess them in the land of the LORD for servants and handmaids: and they shall take them captives, whose captives they were; and they shall rule over their oppressors. 14:3 And it shall come to pass in the day that the LORD shall give thee rest from thy sorrow, and from thy fear, and from the hard bondage wherein thou wast made to serve, 14:4 That thou shalt take up this proverb against **the king of Babylon,** and say, How hath the oppressor ceased! the golden city ceased!  14:5 The LORD hath broken the staff of the wicked, and the sceptre of the rulers. 14:6 He who smote the people in wrath with a continual stroke, he that ruled the nations in anger, is persecuted, and none hindereth. 14:7 The whole earth is at rest, and is quiet: they break forth into singing. 14:8 Yea, the fir trees rejoice at thee, and the cedars of Lebanon, saying, Since thou art laid down, no feller is come up against us. 14:9 **Hell from beneath is moved** for thee to meet thee at thy coming: it stirreth up the dead for thee, even all the chief ones of the earth; it hath raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations. 14:10 All they shall speak and say unto thee, Art thou also become weak as we? art thou become like unto us?  14:11 Thy pomp is brought down to the grave, and the noise of thy viols: the worm is spread under thee, and the worms cover thee. 
> 14:12 **How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning!** how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations! 14:13 **For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north: 14:14 I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High.** 14:15 Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit. 14:16 They that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee, and consider thee, saying, Is this the man that made the earth to tremble, that did shake kingdoms; 14:17 That made the world as a wilderness, and destroyed the cities thereof; that opened not the house of his prisoners?  14:18 All the kings of the nations, even all of them, lie in glory, every one in his own house. 14:19 But thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch, and as the raiment of those that are slain, thrust through with a sword, that go down to the stones of the pit; as a carcase trodden under feet. 14:20 Thou shalt not be joined with them in burial, because thou hast destroyed thy land, and slain thy people: the seed of evildoers shall never be renowned. 14:21 Prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their fathers; that they do not rise, nor possess the land, nor fill the face of the world with cities. 14:22 For I will rise up against them, saith the LORD of hosts, and cut off from Babylon the name, and remnant, and son, and nephew, saith the LORD. 14:23 I will also make it a possession for the bittern, and pools of water: and I will sweep it with the besom of destruction, saith the LORD of hosts. 14:24 The LORD of hosts hath sworn, saying, Surely as I have thought, so shall it come to pass; and as I have purposed, so shall it stand: 14:25 That I will break the Assyrian in my land, and upon my mountains tread him under foot: then shall his yoke depart from off them, and his burden depart from off their shoulders 14:26 This is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth: and this is the hand that is stretched out upon all the nations. 14:27 For the LORD of hosts hath purposed, and who shall disannul it? and his hand is stretched out, and who shall turn it back?  14:28 In the year that king Ahaz died was this burden. 14:29 Rejoice not thou, whole Palestina, because the rod of him that smote thee is broken: for out of the serpentâ€™s root shall come forth a cockatrice, and his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent. 14:30 And the firstborn of the poor shall feed, and the needy shall lie down in safety: and I will kill thy root with famine, and he shall slay thy remnant. 14:31 Howl, O gate; cry, O city; thou, whole Palestina, art dissolved: for there shall come from the north a smoke, and none shall be alone in his appointed times. 14:32 What shall one then answer the messengers of the nation? That the LORD hath founded Zion, and the poor of his people shall trust in it."

Here we see God talking about a "king of Babylon". In other parts of the Bible (Revelation in particular) Babylon is a symbol of worldliness, sinful pleasure, and opposition to God.

This "king of Babylon" is addressed by God in the following way:

> "14:12 How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations! 14:13 For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north: 14:14 I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High. 14:15 Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit."

The word used to address him is "Lucifer". Of course, "Lucifer" (the English word) came much later via Latin ("light-bearing/morning star"). Nonetheless, even the context of the word indicates that this being is supernatural, having "fallen from heaven". In the KJV, this is the only instance where the word "Lucifer" is used. 

It is clear that Lucifer is an adversary/enemy/satan to God. And God explains how he plans to suppress Lucifer. 

What did Lucifer do to deserve this harsh treatment? Pride and ambition. Lucifer wanted "be like the most High [God]". 

But God does not like competitors showing up on the scene. So, God pulls an "alpha male" move by expelling Lucifer from Heaven and sending him to Hell. 

### In summary

**Satan is the fallen angel, "Lucifer". Lucifer is prideful and ambitious. Since God hates competition, he seeks to suppress Lucifer.**

## Ezekiel 27 -- 28:1-19 ðŸ˜ˆ Satan: the G.O.A.T.

[Emph. added]

> "27:1 The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying, 27:2 Now, thou son of man, take up a lamentation for **Tyrus**; 27:3 And say unto Tyrus, O thou that art situate at the entry of the sea, which art **a merchant of the people for many isles,** Thus saith the Lord GOD; **O Tyrus, thou hast said, I am of perfect beauty.** 27:4 Thy borders are in the midst of the seas, thy builders have perfected thy beauty. 27:5 They have made all thy ship boards of fir trees of Senir: they have taken cedars from Lebanon to make masts for thee. 27:6 Of the oaks of Bashan have they made thine oars; the company of the Ashurites have made thy benches of ivory, brought out of the isles of Chittim. 27:7 Fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was that which thou spreadest forth to be thy sail; blue and purple from the isles of Elishah was that which covered thee. 27:8 The inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad were thy mariners: thy wise men, O Tyrus, that were in thee, were thy pilots. 27:9 The ancients of Gebal and the wise men thereof were in thee thy calkers: all the ships of the sea with their mariners were in thee to occupy thy merchandise. 27:10 They of Persia and of Lud and of Phut were in thine army, thy men of war: they hanged the shield and helmet in thee; they set forth thy comeliness. 27:11 The men of Arvad with thine army were upon thy walls round about, and the Gammadims were in thy towers: they hanged their shields upon thy walls round about; they have made thy beauty perfect. 27:12 Tarshish was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of all kind of riches; with silver, iron, tin, and lead, they traded in thy fairs. 27:13 Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they were thy merchants: they traded the persons of men and vessels of brass in thy market. 27:14 They of the house of Togarmah traded in thy fairs with horses and horsemen and mules. 27:15 The men of Dedan were thy merchants; many isles were the merchandise of thine hand: they brought thee for a present horns of ivory and ebony. 27:16 Syria was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of the wares of thy making: they occupied in thy fairs with emeralds, purple, and broidered work, and fine linen, and coral, and agate. 27:17 Judah, and the land of Israel, they were thy merchants: they traded in thy market wheat of Minnith, and Pannag, and honey, and oil, and balm. 27:18 Damascus was thy merchant in the multitude of the wares of thy making, for the multitude of all riches; in the wine of Helbon, and white wool. 27:19 Dan also and Javan going to and fro occupied in thy fairs: bright iron, cassia, and calamus, were in thy market. 27:20 Dedan was thy merchant in precious clothes for chariots. 27:21 Arabia, and all the princes of Kedar, they occupied with thee in lambs, and rams, and goats: in these were they thy merchants. 27:22 The merchants of Sheba and Raamah, they were thy merchants: they occupied in thy fairs with chief of all spices, and with all precious stones, and gold. 27:23 Haran, and Canneh, and Eden, the merchants of Sheba, Asshur, and Chilmad, were thy merchants. 27:24 These were thy merchants in all sorts of things, in blue clothes, and broidered work, and in chests of rich apparel, bound with cords, and made of cedar, among thy merchandise. 27:25 The ships of Tarshish did sing of thee in thy market: and thou wast replenished, and made very glorious in the midst of the seas. 27:26 Thy rowers have brought thee into great waters: the east wind hath broken thee in the midst of the seas. 27:27 **Thy riches, and thy fairs, thy merchandise, thy mariners, and thy pilots, thy calkers, and the occupiers of thy merchandise, and all thy men of war, that are in thee, and in all thy company which is in the midst of thee, shall fall into the midst of the seas in the day of thy ruin.** 27:28 The suburbs shall shake at the sound of the cry of thy pilots. 27:29 And all that handle the oar, the mariners, and all the pilots of the sea, shall come down from their ships, they shall stand upon the land; 27:30 And shall cause their voice to be heard against thee, and shall cry bitterly, and shall cast up dust upon their heads, they shall wallow themselves in the ashes: 27:31 And they shall make themselves utterly bald for thee, and gird them with sackcloth, and they shall weep for thee with bitterness of heart and bitter wailing. 27:32 And in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and lament over thee, saying, What city is like Tyrus, like the destroyed in the midst of the sea?  27:33 When thy wares went forth out of the seas, thou filledst many people; thou didst enrich the kings of the earth with the multitude of thy riches and of thy merchandise. 27:34 In the time when thou shalt be broken by the seas in the depths of the waters thy merchandise and all thy company in the midst of thee shall fall. 27:35 All the inhabitants of the isles shall be astonished at thee, and their kings shall be sore afraid, they shall be troubled in their countenance. 27:36 The merchants among the people shall hiss at thee; thou shalt be a terror, and never shalt be any more. 
> 
> 28:1 The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying, 28:2 Son of man, say unto the **prince of Tyrus**, Thus saith the Lord GOD; **Because thine heart is lifted up, and thou hast said, I am a God, I sit in the seat of God, in the midst of the seas; yet thou art a man, and not God, though thou set thine heart as the heart of God: 28:3 Behold, thou art wiser than Daniel; there is no secret that they can hide from thee: 28:4 With thy wisdom and with thine understanding thou hast gotten thee riches, and hast gotten gold and silver into thy treasures: 28:5 By thy great wisdom and by thy traffick hast thou increased thy riches, and thine heart is lifted up because of thy riches:** 28:6 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast set thine heart as the heart of God; 28:7 Behold, therefore I will bring strangers upon thee, the terrible of the nations: and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of thy wisdom, and they shall defile thy brightness. 28:8 They shall bring thee down to the pit, and thou shalt die the deaths of them that are slain in the midst of the seas. 28:9 Wilt thou yet say before him that slayeth thee, I am God? but thou shalt be a man, and no God, in the hand of him that slayeth thee. 28:10 Thou shalt die the deaths of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD. 
> 
> 28:11 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 28:12 Son of man, take up a lamentation upon the **king of Tyrus**, and say unto him, Thus saith the Lord GOD; **Thou sealest up the sum, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty. 28:13 Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created. 28:14 Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire. 28:15 Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee. 28:16 By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God: and I will destroy thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire. 28:17 Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I will cast thee to the ground,** I will lay thee before kings, that they may behold thee. 28:18 Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffick; therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour thee, and I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee. 28:19 All they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at thee: thou shalt be a terror, and never shalt thou be any more."

Here again, Satan is being referred to under psudonyms. This time it is "Tyrus", "prince of Tyrus", and "king of Tyrus". 

God describes Satan as being beautiful, prosperous, and proud. Satan is a Capitalist and has many trade partners. Everyone loves to make deals with the Devil. 

### In summary

**Satan is a very savvy businessperson and has a history of occupying positions of privilege. However, due to Satan's pride, God seeks to bring him down.**

## Zechariah 3 ðŸ˜ˆ Satan: the Resister

[Emph. added]

> "3:1 And he shewed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, **and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him. 3:2 And the LORD said unto Satan, The LORD rebuke thee, O Satan;** even the LORD that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?  3:3 Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before the angel. 3:4 And he answered and spake unto those that stood before him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from him. And unto him he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment. 3:5 And I said, Let them set a fair mitre upon his head. So they set a fair mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments. And the angel of the LORD stood by. 3:6 And the angel of the LORD protested unto Joshua, saying, 3:7 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If thou wilt walk in my ways, and if thou wilt keep my charge, then thou shalt also judge my house, and shalt also keep my courts, and I will give thee places to walk among these that stand by. 3:8 Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou, and thy fellows that sit before thee: for they are men wondered at: for, behold, I will bring forth my servant the BRANCH. 3:9 For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon one stone shall be seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the graving thereof, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day. 3:10 In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, shall ye call every man his neighbour under the vine and under the fig tree."

Satan is the resister in this passage. 

### In summary

**Satan is the one who resists.**

## Matthew ðŸ˜ˆ
### 4:1-11 ðŸ˜ˆ Satan: the Tempter

> "4:1 Then was Jesus led up of the spirit **into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.** 4:2 And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungred. 4:3 And when **the tempter** came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread. 4:4 But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. 4:5 Then **the devil** taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple, 4:6 And saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone. 4:7 Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God. 4:8 Again, **the devil** taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them; 4:9 And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me. 4:10 Then saith Jesus unto him, **Get thee hence, Satan**: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve. 4:11 Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him."

In this passage, Satan interacts with Jesus. Satan is the Tempter, he tempts Jesus to commit sins by
1. Using his divine power to satisfy his own physical need (prolonged hunger) by turning stones into bread.
2. Doing an action which would provide proof of whether supernatural beings would be able and willing to intervene in what would appear to otherwise be an act of suicide. 
3. Worshiping the Devil in exchange for worldly glory. 

#### In summary

**Satan is the tempter.**

### 13 ðŸ˜ˆ Satan: the Sower of Doubt

Jesus gives lessons in the form of parables.

> "13:1 The same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea side. 13:2 And great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that he went into a ship, and sat; and the whole multitude stood on the shore. 13:3 And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying, Behold, a sower went forth to sow; 13:4 And when he sowed, some seeds fell by the way side, and the fowls came and devoured them up: 13:5 Some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth: and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth: 13:6 And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away. 13:7 And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked them: 13:8 But other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold. 13:9 Who hath ears to hear, let him hear. 13:10 And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables?  13:11 He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given. 13:12 For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath. 13:13 Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand. 13:14 And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive: 13:15 For this peopleâ€™s heart is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears, and should understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them. 13:16 But blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear. 13:17 For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them. 13:18 Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower. 13:19 **When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the way side.** 13:20 But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it; 13:21 Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended. 13:22 He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful. 13:23 But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty. 
> 
> 13:24 Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field: 13:25 **But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way.** 13:26 But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also. 13:27 So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares?  13:28 He said unto them, **An enemy hath done this.** The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?  13:29 But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them. 13:30 Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, **Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.** 
>
> 13:31 Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field: 13:32 Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof. 13:33 Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened. 13:34 All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and without a parable spake he not unto them: 13:35 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world. 
> 
> 13:36 Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field. 13:37 He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man; 13:38 The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; **but the tares are the children of the wicked one; 13:39 The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels. 13:40 As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world. 13:41 The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity; 13:42 And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.** 13:43 Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear. 13:44 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field. 13:45 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls: 13:46 Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it. 13:47 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind: 13:48 Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away. 13:49 So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just, 13:50 And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth. 13:51 Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things? They say unto him, Yea, Lord. 13:52 Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe which is instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old. 13:53 And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence. 13:54 And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?  13:55 Is not this the carpenterâ€™s son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?  13:56 And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this man all these things? 13:57 And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own house. 13:58 And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief."



Here, Jesus tells allegories about his purported religious truth, and how Satan works to (in Jesus' opinion) distort that truth. Jesus also tells allegories about burning sinners as a form of divine judgement, which obviously brings up the concept of Hell. 

#### The Parable of the Sower

In one of the parables, Jesus says that a man is sowing seeds in a diverse range of environments. In each environment, the seeds grow into plants that are impacted by where they landed. One of these environments in the road, where birds (symbolizing Satan/devils) remove the seeds (Jesus' worldview) from the listener's mind (13:19). Thus, Satan is blamed for leading humans to reject the messaging that Jesus puts out. 

This makes it very natural for many of Jesus' followers (even today) to view anything that challenges Christ's messaging to be inherently of Satan. 

#### The Wheat and Tares

Another parable represents Satan sowing sinners among the righteus. In the population of people who are aligned with God, there are people who embrace sin. God decides to let them mingle and then burns the sinners later.


#### In summary

**Satan is the sower of doubt. He encourages people to think in ways that God does not approve.**

### 16:21-28 ðŸ˜ˆ Satan: the Self-Preservationist

#### Text

> "16:21 From that time forth began Jesus to shew unto his disciples, how that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day. 16:22 Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee. 16:23 But he turned, and said unto Peter, **Get thee behind me, Satan: thou art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men.** 16:24 Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. 16:25 For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it. 16:26 For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?  16:27 For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works. 16:28 Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom."

#### Get thee behind me, Satan!

Peter (one of Jesus' disciples) exhorted Jesus to avoid physical harm. However, Jesus recognizes the "adversary" through Peter, and responds with an iconic line: 

> "Get thee behind me, Satan: thou art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men."

Jesus is concerned with his spiritual mission on earth, and sees Peter's preoccupation with the physical necessities of life to be contrary to that mission. 

Thus, Jesus calls Peter his adversary in that moment. 

#### In summary

**A "satan" is anyone who places a strong priority on self-preservation and for one's own physical welfare ABOVE what God says. Those who encourage others to practice self-preservation can also be considered a satanic influence.**

### 25:31-46 ðŸ˜ˆ Satan: the Most Prominent of the Goats

#### Text

> "25:31 When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory: 25:32 And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats: 25:33 **And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.** 25:34 Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: 25:35 For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in: 25:36 Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me. 25:37 Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?  25:38 When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?  25:39 Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?  25:40 And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me. 25:41 **Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:** 25:42 For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink: 25:43 I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not. 25:44 Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?  25:45 Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me. 25:46 **And these shall go away into everlasting punishment:** but the righteous into life eternal."

#### The final judgement between the sheep and the goats

Jesus' followers are referred to as "sheep", while Satan's followers (which, let's be honest, is really just everyone NOT in Jesus' followers) are referred to as "goats". 

We can represent this with an `if else` statement

```
if follows_jesus == True:
    classification = "sheep"
else:
    classification = "goats"
```

...or use a ternary operator instead...

```classification = "sheep" if follows_jesus else "goats" ```

Here, Jesus makes clear that benevolence and charity are essential to being a true Christian (follower of himself). Even the most well-intentioned loyalists to Christ can become "goats" if Christ doesn't like how they treat their fellow humans. 

I also asked OpenAI's ChatGPT about the behavioral differences between goats and sheep. Here is part of its response:

> Behaviorally, sheep tend to be more docile and flock-oriented, while goats are more independent and curious. Sheep tend to follow a leader and stay close to the flock, while goats are more likely to explore and forage on their own. Sheep are also generally more skittish and easily frightened than goats, which can make them more challenging to handle.
>
> In terms of social behavior, sheep are more likely to form a hierarchy or "pecking order" within a flock, with dominant individuals having greater access to resources. Goats, on the other hand, tend to have a more relaxed social structure and are less likely to establish a hierarchy.


#### Summary

**God has prepared Hell for Satan, his demons, and for everyone who is NOT one of Jesus' sheep. Satan is the most prominent goat (non-follower of Jesus).**

## Luke ðŸ˜ˆ
### 10:1-24 ðŸ˜ˆ Satan: the Descending Lightning Bolt, the Undertrodden Serpent.

#### Text

> 10:1 After these things the LORD appointed other seventy also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, whither he himself would come. 10:2 Therefore said he unto them, The harvest truly is great, but the labourers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth labourers into his harvest. 10:3 Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves. 10:4 Carry neither purse, nor scrip, nor shoes: and salute no man by the way. 10:5 And into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace be to this house. 10:6 And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it: if not, it shall turn to you again. 10:7 And in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things as they give: for the labourer is worthy of his hire. Go not from house to house. 10:8 And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you: 10:9 And heal the sick that are therein, and say unto them, The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you. 10:10 But into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you not, go your ways out into the streets of the same, and say, 10:11 Even the very dust of your city, which cleaveth on us, we do wipe off against you: notwithstanding be ye sure of this, that the kingdom of God is come nigh unto you. 10:12 But I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that city. 10:13 Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which have been done in you, they had a great while ago repented, sitting in sackcloth and ashes. 10:14 But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment, than for you. 10:15 And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted to heaven, shalt be thrust down to hell. 10:16 He that heareth you heareth me; and he that despiseth you despiseth me; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me. 10:17 **And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are subject unto us through thy name. 10:18 And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven. 10:19 Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you. 10:20 Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject unto you; but rather rejoice, because your names are written in heaven.** 10:21 In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that **thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes:** even so, Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight. 10:22 All things are delivered to me of my Father: and no man knoweth who the Son is, but the Father; and who the Father is, but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him. 10:23 And he turned him unto his disciples, and said privately, Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see: 10:24 For I tell you, that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them.

#### Satan and devils get trampled by Jesus' followers

In this passage, Jesus sends 70 missionaries to do his work. Jesus enables them to make the "devils" submit to them. 

Jesus says he "beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven."

Jesus also says "I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy:". This is particularly interesting when reading it in a contemporary context.

Of course, treading on serpents alludes to Genesis where God said that Eve's offspring would tread on the serpent's offspring.


#### Summary

**Satan is a fallen angel. He is among the undertrodden enemies of Jesus/God.**

### 13:10-17 ðŸ˜ˆ Satan: the Blame Recipient for Maladies

#### Text

> 13:10 And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath. 13:11 And, behold, there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and was bowed together, and could in no wise lift up herself. 13:12 And when Jesus saw her, he called her to him, and said unto her, Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity. 13:13 And he laid his hands on her: and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God. 13:14 And the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation, because that Jesus had healed on the sabbath day, and said unto the people, There are six days in which men ought to work: in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the sabbath day. 13:15 The Lord then answered him, and said, Thou hypocrite, doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall, and lead him away to watering?  13:16 And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, **whom Satan hath bound,** lo, these eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day?  13:17 And when he had said these things, all his adversaries were ashamed: and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him.

#### Summary

**Physical maladies are blamed on Satan.**

### 22:1-6 ðŸ˜ˆ Satan: the Possessor of Judas

#### Text

> 22:1 Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is called the Passover. 22:2 And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him; for they feared the people. 22:3 **Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot,** being of the number of the twelve. 22:4 And he went his way, and communed with the chief priests and captains, how he might betray him unto them. 22:5 And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money. 22:6 And he promised, and sought opportunity to betray him unto them in the absence of the multitude.

#### Satan possesses Judas

Satan is blamed for inspiring Judas to betray Jesus. 

Note that Judas gets financially compensated for his betrayal (althoguh he reportedly becomes regretful according to other passages). 

#### Summary

**Satan is blamed for making humans do bad stuff. #TheDevilMadeMeDoIt**

### 22:31-34 ðŸ˜ˆ Satan: the Imminent Threat to Christian Devotion

#### Text

> 22:31 And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, **Satan hath desired to have you,** that he may sift you as wheat: 22:32 But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren. 22:33 And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison, and to death. 22:34 And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.

#### Jesus warns Peter about Satan 

With Judas having been possessed by Satan, Jesus warns peter of the potential of Satan being involved in Peter's decision-making processes as well. 

#### Summary

**Satan is viewed as an imminent and mysterious spiritual force that threatens the devotion of Christians.**

### 8:37-52 ðŸ˜ˆ Satan: the Ad Hominem Tool and the "Father of Lies"

#### Text

> 8:37 I know that ye are Abrahamâ€™s seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you. 8:38 I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father. 8:39 They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abrahamâ€™s children, ye would do the works of Abraham. 8:40 But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham. 8:41 Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God. 8:42 Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me. 8:43 Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word. 8:44 **Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.** 8:45 And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not. 8:46 Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me?  8:47 He that is of God heareth Godâ€™s words: ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God. 8:48 Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?  8:49 Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me. 8:50 And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth. 8:51 Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death. 8:52 Then said the Jews unto him, **Now we know that thou hast a devil.** Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death.

#### Blame game between Jesus and the Jews around him

Jesus and his fellow Jews criticized each other, claiming that the other side was possessed by devil(s). 

![If 2 people are in a debate, and one argues that the other is demon-possessed, is that a logical fallacy? It would be a logical fallacy known as ad hominem, which means attacking the person instead of their argument. This type of argument is fallacious because it attempts to undermine the person's argument by attacking their character or personal attributes, rather than addressing the actual evidence or reasoning presented. It is a logical fallacy because the person's possession by a demon is irrelevant to the truth or falsity of the argument they are making.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67705789/213946923-ae08653a-70b3-48dc-bf66-0650ac48c4ee.png)

#### Summary

**If my enemy makes me triggered in a debate, then I'll just tell him that he's possessed by Satan! #AdHominem**

Also, Jesus calls Satan a "murderer", and the "father [of lies]". 

### 10:1-21 ðŸ˜ˆ Satan: the Possessor of...Jesus?

#### Text

> 10:1 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber. 10:2 But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. 10:3 To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out. 10:4 And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice. 10:5 And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers. 10:6 This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them. 10:7 Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep. 10:8 All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them. 10:9 I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture. 10:10 The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly. 10:11 I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep. 10:12 But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep. 10:13 The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep. 10:14 I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine. 10:15 As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep. 10:16 And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd. 10:17 Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again. 10:18 No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father. 10:19 There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings. 10:20 And many of them said, **He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye him?  10:21 Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?**

#### Satan as an ad hominem tool (again)

Here, Satan is used as a tool to discredit what someone has to say. Don't like what someone says? Gossip about how they are demon-possessed/crazy. 

Another interesting thing to note is that this passage repeats the theme of Jesus' followers being described as "sheep" [in contrast to the Satanic "goats"]. 

#### Summary

**Once again, Satan is used as an ad hominem tool.**

### 13:21-31 ðŸ˜ˆ Satan: the Possessor of Judas

#### Text 

> 13:21 When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me. 13:22 Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake. 13:23 Now there was leaning on Jesusâ€™ bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved. 13:24 Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake. 13:25 He then lying on Jesusâ€™ breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it? 13:26 Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped it. And when he had dipped the sop, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon. 13:27 **And after the sop Satan entered into him.** Then said Jesus unto him, That thou doest, do quickly. 13:28 Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him. 13:29 For some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus had said unto him, Buy those things that we have need of against the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor. 13:30 He then having received the sop went immediately out: and it was night. 13:31 Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him

#### Summary

Satan is believed to have entered Judas during the Last Supper.

### 14:30-31 ðŸ˜ˆ Satan: the Prince of This World

#### Text

> 14:30 Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me. 14:31 But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go hence.

#### Summary

Here, Jesus referrs to Satan as **"The Prince of this World"**.

## Romans ðŸ˜ˆ
### 13:1-7 ðŸ˜ˆ God: the Ordainer of Arbitrary Authorities

#### Text

> 13:1 Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God. 13:2 **Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation.** 13:3 For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same: 13:4 For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil. 13:5 Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake. 13:6 For for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are Godâ€™s ministers, attending continually upon this very thing. 13:7 Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour.

#### Satanists challenge arbitrary authority

Since God is endorsing the worldly rulers, it is natural that those who would challenge arbitrary authority would be labeled as "satanic". 

#### Summary

Satan (as the adversary of God and based on his presence in the greater context of the Bible) can be viewed as a challenger of arbitrary authority, both in heaven and on earth. 

### 16:17-20 ðŸ˜ˆ Satan: the Evil to be Bruised Underfoot

#### Text

> 16:17 Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them. 16:18 For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple. 16:19 For your obedience is come abroad unto all men. I am glad therefore on your behalf: but yet I would have you wise unto that which is good, and simple concerning evil. 16:20 **And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly.** The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.

#### Summary

Once again, **Satan is portrayed as a being that is to be bruised underfoot.**

## 1 Corinthians 7 ðŸ˜ˆ Satan: the Promoter of Human Libido

### Text

> 7:1 Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: It is good for a man not to touch a woman. 7:2 Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband. 7:3 Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and likewise also the wife unto the husband. 7:4 The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife. 7:5 Defraud ye not one the other, except it be with consent for a time, **that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency.** 7:6 But I speak this by permission, and not of commandment. 7:7 For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that. 7:8 I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I. 7:9 But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn. 7:10 And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband: 7:11 But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband: and let not the husband put away his wife. 7:12 But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away. 7:13 And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him. 7:14 For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy. 7:15 But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases: but God hath called us to peace. 7:16 For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband?  or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy wife?  7:17 But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath called every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches. 7:18 Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised. 7:19 Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God. 7:20 Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called. 7:21 Art thou called being a servant? care not for it: but if thou mayest be made free, use it rather. 7:22 For he that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lordâ€™s freeman: likewise also he that is called, being free, is Christâ€™s servant. 7:23 Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men. 7:24 Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide with God. 7:25 Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful. 7:26 I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, I say, that it is good for a man so to be. 7:27 Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife. 7:28 But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh: but I spare you. 7:29 But this I say, brethren, the time is short: it remaineth, that both they that have wives be as though they had none; 7:30 And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not; 7:31 And they that use this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion of this world passeth away. 7:32 But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord: 7:33 But he that is married careth for the things that are of the world, how he may please his wife. 7:34 There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married careth for the things of the world, how she may please her husband. 7:35 And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction. 7:36 But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin, if she pass the flower of her age, and need so require, let him do what he will, he sinneth not: let them marry. 7:37 Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well. 7:38 So then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better. 7:39 The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord. 7:40 But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I think also that I have the Spirit of God.

### Satan tempts humans to commit sexual sins

Paul makes a sort of spectrum of devotion to God. Actual "sin" is at one extreme with sex outside of marriage. Complete sexual abstinence and celibacy with 100% focus on serving Jesus is at the other extreme. And then there is some grey area in between which (according to Paul) is not necessarily sinful, but which he still frowns upon. 

### Summary

Satan encourages human libido, often contrary to the "holy" pursuits of a Christian missionary lifestyle. 

## 2 Corinthians ðŸ˜ˆ

### 11:1-15 ðŸ˜ˆ Satan: the Shapeshifter, the Angel of Light

#### Text

> 11:1 Would to God ye could bear with me a little in my folly: and indeed bear with me. 11:2 For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ. 11:3 **But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.** 11:4 For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or if ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with him. 11:5 For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles. 11:6 But though I be rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have been throughly made manifest among you in all things. 11:7 Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely? 11:8 I robbed other churches, taking wages of them, to do you service. 11:9 And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all things I have kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and so will I keep myself. 11:10 As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia. 11:11 Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth. 11:12 But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we. 11:13 For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ. 11:14 And no marvel; **for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.** 11:15 Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.

#### Summary

Here, the Serpent of Genesis is mentioned again. Also, Satan is described as a shapeshifter who is able to impersonate "an angel of light".

## Ephesians ðŸ˜ˆ
### 2:1-3 ðŸ˜ˆ Satan: the Prince of the Power of the Air, the Promoter of Carnal Indulgence

#### Text

> 2:1 And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins; 2:2 Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to **the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience:** 2:3 Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.

#### Summary

Satan is "the prince of the power of the air". He makes people want to sin. But a person's own "flesh" also is driving the motive to sin. So Satan can be used as a symbol for representing the carnal nature of humanity. 

### 4:17 -- 6:20 ðŸ˜ˆ Satan: Spiritual Wickedness in High Places

#### Text 

> 4:17 This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind, 4:18 Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart: 4:19 Who being past feeling have **given themselves over unto lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness.** 4:20 But ye have not so learned Christ; 4:21 If so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus: 4:22 That ye put off concerning the former conversation **the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;** 4:23 And be renewed in the spirit of your mind; 4:24 And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness. 4:25 Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour: for we are members one of another. 4:26 Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath: 4:27 **Neither give place to the devil.** 4:28 Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth. 4:29 Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers. 4:30 And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption. 4:31 Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice: 4:32 And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christâ€™s sake hath forgiven you. 5:1 Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children; 5:2 And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour. 5:3 **But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints; 5:4 Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks. 5:5 For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. 5:6 Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience. 5:7 Be not ye therefore partakers with them. 5:8 For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light: 5:9 (For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth;) 5:10 Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord. 5:11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them. 5:12 For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret.** 5:13 But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light. 5:14 Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light. 5:15 See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise, 5:16 **Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.** 5:17 Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is. 5:18 And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit; 5:19 Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord; 5:20 Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ; 5:21 **Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.** 5:22 Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. 5:23 For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body. 5:24 Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing. 5:25 Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it; 5:26 That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, 5:27 That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish. 5:28 So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself. 5:29 For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church: 5:30 For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones. 5:31 For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh. 5:32 This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church. 5:33 Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband. 6:1 Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right. 6:2 Honour thy father and mother; which is the first commandment with promise; 6:3 That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth. 6:4 And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. 6:5 **Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ; 6:6 Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart; 6:7 With good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men:** 6:8 Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free. 6:9 And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him. 6:10 Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. 6:11 **Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. 6:12 For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.** 6:13 Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. 6:14 Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness; 6:15 And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace; 6:16 Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. 6:17 And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God: 6:18 Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints; 6:19 And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel, 6:20 For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.

It's interesting to note that Paul (a Christian) describes evil/sinful/satanic behaviors, including those that have victims (like stealing) as well as those that do not have victims (like lust). 

Also, the strong emphasis on compliance and subservience to God and to worldly "masters" reinforces the message of Romans 13. Should an enslaved person wholeheartedly work to enrich the person who enslaved them? According to Paul, YES. 

The struggle between God and Satan is described in this context not as one of "flesh and blood", but of "principalities, ...powers, ...rulers of the darkness of this world, [and]...spiritual wickedness in high places."

#### Summary

Paul (in classic Christian fashion) lists both victimless and victimfull "sins" in his lists of evil behaviors which followers of God must avoid in their efforts to resist the Devil. 

## James 4:1-10 ðŸ˜ˆ Satan: the Pragmatist

### Text

> 4:1 From whence come wars and fightings among you? come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members?  4:2 Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not. 4:3 Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts. 4:4 **Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.** 4:5 Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?  4:6 But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble. 4:7 Submit yourselves therefore to God. **Resist the devil,** and he will flee from you. 4:8 Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded. 4:9 Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness. 4:10 Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.

### Summary

Once again, sexual sins are used to characterize satanic influence. 

In addition, friendship with "the world" is mutually exclusive to friendship with God. Therefore, since friendship with the world is emnity with God, pragmatism can be viewed as "satanic". 

## 1 Peter 5:6-11 ðŸ˜ˆ Satan: the Roaring Lion

Amen.

### Summary

Satan is described as being like "a roaring lion".
