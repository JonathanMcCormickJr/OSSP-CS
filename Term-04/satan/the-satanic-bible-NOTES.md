## The Nine Satanic Statements

These are listed on a single page before the main parts of the book. 

The Nine Satanic Statements include:

**1. "Satan represents indulgence instead of abstinence!"** This is explained 
in more nuance later in the book. LaVey makes it clear that an individual's
sense of agency is reduced when they are deprived of natural needs and desires
for prolonged periods of time. Thus, LaVey encourages his followers to "indulge" in
those "vices" in a deliberate, safe way. Otherwise, that axiety and desire will 
build up and may be involuntarily released in a destructive, unhealthy manner. Thus
the LaVeyan recognizes that indulgense does not equal compulsion. Indulgence puts the 
person's own self in the driver seat. 

**2. "Satan represents vital existence instead of spiritual pipe dreams!"** Satanists live for the current life on earth.
Is there any afterlife? That's debatable. What is known is that this life is here, that it is short, and that it cannot
be taken for granted. The LaVeyan chooses to embrace life in the here and now, without religion-driven suppression
of natural desires. 

**3. "Satan represents undefiled wisdom instead of hypocritical self-deceit!"** 

**4. "Satan represents kindness to those who deserve it instead of love wasted on ingrates!"** 
This draws on some of Ayn Rand's philosophy. 

**5. "Satan represents vengeance instead of turning the other cheek!"** This is "an eye for an eye", 
a clear opposition point to the New Testament. "Satan" literally means "adversary", so it makes 
sense that LaVey would have an _adversarial_ tone when it comes to dealing with people who have 
done harm to oneself.

**6. "Satan represents responsibility to the responsible instead of concern for psychic vampires!"**
As LaVey later clarifies, a "psychic vampire" is not someone who literally drinks another's blood, but rather 
is someone who drains the "vital energy" from others: one to whom others irrationally feel obliged 
to care for with little to no actual value in return. (pp.75-80)

**7. "Satan represents man as just another animal, sometimes better, more often worse than those 
that walk on all-fours, who, because of his 'divine spiritual and intellectual development,' 
has become the most vicious animal of all!"** Regrettably, LaVey is not a statistician. The "more often worse"
part is a DATA claim. But LaVey does not clearly provide evidence to back up his data claim. 
He makes this claim (presumably) because of his background as a lion tamer and other interactions he 
has had with animals COMBINED with his experience as a photographer for law enforcement. 
Since his data claim is based on his own personal experience, there is little weight to it, IMHO. 
Regardless of how one might define "goodness", there was no objective study effort made to 
quantify it here. There are plenty of crime scenes which show the ugly side of humanity. And 
there are plenty of zoos which show the pretty side of the rest the animal kingdom. Thus, LaVey likely 
had a warped view of humanity and the animal kingdom. Perhaps he should at least have watched more Curiousity Stream
nature videos. The animal kingdom is filled with heartless "crimes" against other beings. So if someone 
wants to find evidence for or against human goodness, they have plenty of material to support whatever side they pick. 
But to get a REAL answer to a question like, "Are humans (as a whole) better or worse than other animals?", one must 1. 
Define "better" and "worse" in a way that's quantifiable (e.g. "Better: Existing in a way to produce fewer pain signals 
in the nervous systems of other sentient beings", "Worse: Existing in a way to produce more pain signals 
in the nervous systems of other sentient beings").

**8. "Satan represents all of the so-called sins, as they all lead to physical, mental, or emotional gratification!"**

**9. "Satan has been the best friend the Church has ever had, as He has kept it in business all these years!"**

## Structure of The Satanic Bible

It's divided into 4 "books". Each book is named after a crown prince of Hell
and is associated a certain mythical "element" as follows:
1. (FIRE) The Book of Satan: The Infernal Diatribe.
2. (AIR) The Book of Lucifer: The Enlightenment.
3. (EARTH) The Book of Belial: The Mastery of the Earth.
4. (WATER) The Book of Leviathan: The Raging Sea.


## 1. (FIRE) The Book of Satan: The Infernal Diatribe.

The Book of Satan is a poem of blasphemy against the traditional "God".
