##### PROJECT: Mini Underground Bunker
* Pre-work
  * Design the structure.
    * Water-resistance
      * Ensure that the design of the bunker includes a good drainage system to channel water away from the bunker. The slope of the bunker floor should also be designed in such a way that water drains away from the structure.
      * Water-resistant concrete mix: Use a water-resistant concrete mix, which contains additives such as silica fume, fly ash or slag. These additives help to reduce the size of the pores in the concrete and make it less permeable to water.
      * Sealants: Apply a waterproof sealant to the surface of the concrete bunker. There are different types of sealants, such as acrylic, epoxy, and polyurethane. Choose a sealant that is suitable for the conditions in which the bunker will be used.
      * Membrane systems: Consider using a waterproof membrane system. A membrane system involves placing a layer of waterproof material over the concrete. This layer can be made of various materials such as PVC, bitumen, or EPDM.
      * Drainage: Install a proper drainage system to ensure that water is diverted away from the bunker. This can include French drains, sump pumps or other systems.
    * Physical strength
      * Use scientific principles to distribute the forces that the structure will experience. 
    * Aesthetics
      * Make it look cool.
      * Furniture
    * Redundancy
      * Redundant power
      * Redundant entries/exits
  * Permitting
    * Pick a municipality.
    * Go through a mock permitting process as if you were to actually build a struture in that municipality. 
    * Research all rules and regulations for that community. Write a report on land use restrictions for that jurisdiction.
    * In real life, get parents' permission for location of bunker project.
  * Calculate upfront and ongoing costs
    * 20+ acres lot in that town (price, agent, closing costs, transaction fees and taxes). 
    * Permitting/regulatory approval costs (fees, paperwork, sitting through bureacracy).
    * Property tax before and after your planned improvement. 
  * Plan for contingencies.
    * What if you hit solid granite halfway through excavation?
    * What if a neighbor objects to your construction and files requests with the city to halt construction?
      *  Review the basis of the objection: Find out the specific grounds on which the neighbor is objecting to your construction project. This will help you determine the strength of their objection and whether it has any legal basis.
      *  Consult with an attorney: It is advisable to seek legal advice from an attorney who is experienced in land use and zoning issues. They can help you understand your legal rights and obligations, and advise you on how to proceed.
      *  Communicate with the neighbor: Try to communicate with the neighbor and understand their concerns. You may be able to address their concerns by modifying the design of your project or by making some other concessions. It is important to maintain a respectful and professional tone throughout any interactions.
      *  Attend any hearings or meetings: If the city decides to hold a hearing or meeting to review the neighbor's objection, make sure to attend and present your case. Be prepared to explain how your project meets all the relevant regulations and requirements, and how it will benefit the community.
      *  Follow the city's decision: Once the city has made a decision, make sure to follow it. If the decision is in your favor, you can continue with your construction project. If the decision is against you, you may need to consider modifying your project or pursuing legal action.
      *  If the city rules against you in a manner that is unfair, then getting the media's attention can be a useful tool for influencing public opinion. However, the double-edged nature of news attention should be thoughtfully considered due to the increased potential for heightened scrutiny. 
    * What if the soil has an unexpectedly high water table?
* Build a scale model of an underground bunker.
  * Write detailed documentation of the entire process of planning, construction, and problem-solving. 
  * Take pictures during the entire process.
  * Construct as if you were a 6cm tall person. Build everything to scale with a ratio of 1cm:1ft. 
  * Construct the bunker's frame using cement with steel wire. 
  * Bunker must be dug out from the earth and constructed underground. No open-dropin-close stuff (except for the initial opening to transport dirt out and materials in).
  * Plan and include potable water supply and septic systems. 
* Test it.
  * Watertightness test
    * Make the inside of the bunker arid by rubbing it with dry paper towels and using moisture absorbing materials overnight in it.
    * Carefully remove the moisture absorbers.
    * Place moisture detection objects (dry paper towel, cotton ball) inside dry bunker. 
    * Carefully seal bunker closed. 
    * Run hose water over bunker location until the ground over the bunker is saturated. 
    * Maintain a state of saturation for an hour or two. 
    * After a day, check the bunker's contents for signs of leaked moisture.
      * If the bunker is still dry, then it passes this test. 
      * If the bunker is wet inside, categorize the severity of dampness, investigate potential causes, implement potential solutions, and run this test again.
  * Weight test
    * Take detailed notes and photos of the bunker before. 
    * Measure and place heavy weights on top of the ground where the bunker lies. 
    * Wait 2 days. 
    * Take detailed notes and photos of the bunker after.
    * Compare before and after conditions. 
      * If bunker was unharmed, then it passes this test. 
      * If the bunker shows signs of damage categorize the severity of damage, investigate potential causes, implement potential solutions, and run this test again.
  * Impact test
    * Take detailed notes and photos of the bunker before. 
    * Measure and drop heavy weights on top of the ground where the bunker lies. 
    * Take detailed notes and photos of the bunker after.
    * Compare before and after conditions. 
      * If bunker was unharmed, then it passes this test. 
      * If the bunker shows signs of damage categorize the severity of damage, investigate potential causes, implement potential solutions, and run this test again.
  * Longevity test
    * Place a cache of notes, food, and water in the bunker. Note the date of placement.
    * Seal the bunker. 
    * Revisit it a year later.
    * Note the conditions of the cache contents. Grade based on results.
